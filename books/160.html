			<div class='roleText'>When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou doest enter in to possess, and shall have destroyed many Nations before thee, the Hetheite, and the Gergezeite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Heveite, and the Jebusite, seven nations of much greater number than thou art, and stronger than thou: and the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt strike them unto utter destruction. Thou shalt not make league with them, nor pity them, nor make marriages with them. Thy daughter thou shalt not give to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son: for he will seduce thy son, that he follow not me, and that he rather serve strange gods, and the fury of our Lord will be wrath, and shall quickly destroy thee. But these things rather you shall do to them: Overthrow their altars, and break their statues, and cut down their groves, and burn their sculptiles. Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of all peoples, that are upon the earth. Not because you passed all nations in number, is our Lord joined unto you, &amp; hath chosen you, whereas you are fewer than all peoples: but because our Lord hath loved you, and hath kept the oath, which he sware to your fathers: and hath brought you forth in a strong hand, and redeemed you from the house of servitude, out of the hand of Pharao the king of Aegypt. And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God, he is a strong and faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his precepts, unto a thousand generations: and rendering forthwith to them that hate him, so that he destroyeth them, and deferreth no longer, immediately rendering to them that^ they deserve. Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments, which I command thee this day to do them. If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and do them, the Lord also thy God will keep the covenant unto thee, and the mercy which he sware to thy fathers: and he will love and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and vintage, oil, and herds, the flocks of thy sheep upon the Land, for the which he sware to thy fathers that he would give it thee. Blessed shalt thou be among all peoples. There shall be none barren with thee of neither sex, as well in men as in thy flocks. Our Lord will take away from thee all disease: and the sore infirmities of Aegypt, which thou knowest, he will not bring upon thee, but upon all thine enemies. Thou shalt devour all the peoples, which the Lord thy God will give thee. Thine eye shall not spare them, neither shalt thou serve their gods, lest they be the ruin of thee. If thou say in thy heart: These nations are more than I, how shall I be able to destroy them? Fear not, but remember what the Lord thy God did to Pharao &amp; to all the Aegyptians, the exceeding great plagues, which thine eyes saw, and the signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arm, that the Lord thy God might bring thee forth: so will he do to all peoples, whom thou fearest. Moreover hornets also will the Lord thy God send upon them, until he destroy and consume all that escaped thee, &amp; can hide themselves. Thou shalt not fear them, because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a mighty God &amp; terrible: he will consume these nations in thy sight by little &amp; little and by parts. Thou mayest not destroy them all together: lest perhaps the beasts of the earth multiply against thee. And the Lord thy God will give them in thy sight: an will kill them until they be utterly destroyed. And he will deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy their names under heaven: no man shall be able to resist thee, until thou destroy them. Their sculptiles thou shalt burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver and gold, whereof they were made, neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it is the abomination of the Lord thy God. Neither shalt thou bring in ought of the idol into thy house, lest thou become anathema, as also that is. As filthiness thou shalt detest it, and as uncleanness and filth thou shalt account it abominable, because it is anathema.</div>
