			<div class='roleText'>Fallen fallen is Babylon the great: and it is become the habitation of devils, and the custody of every unclean spirit, &amp; the custody of every unclean &amp; hateful bird: because all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication: and the kings of the earth have fornicated with her: and the merchants of the earth were made rich by the virtue of her delicacies. And I heard another voice from heaven, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Go out from her my people: that you be not partakers of her sins, and receive not of her plagues. Because her sins are come even to heaven, and God hath remembered her iniquities. Render to her as she also hath rendered to you: and double ye double according to her works: In the cup wherein she hath mingled, mingle ye double unto her. As much as she hath glorified herself, &amp; hath been in delicacies, so much give her torment and mourning: because she saith in her heart, I sit a queen, and widow I am not, and mourning I shall not see. Therefore in one day shall her plagues come, death, and mourning, and famine, &amp; with fire she shall be burnt: because God is strong that shall judge her. And the kings of the earth, which have fornicated with her, &amp; have lived in delicacies, shall weep, and bewail themselves upon her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning: standing far off for the fear of her torments, saying: </div>

And the merchants of the earth shall weep, &amp; mourn upon her: because no man shall buy their merchandise any more, merchandise of gold and silver and precious stone: and of pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, &amp; scarlet and all Thyine wood, and all vessels of ivory, and all vessels of precious stone and of brass and iron and marble, and cinnamon, and of odours, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and oil, and flour, &amp; wheat, and beasts, and sheep, and horses, and chariots, &amp; slaves, and souls of men. And the apples of the desire of thy soul are departed from thee, and all fat and goodly things are perished from thee, and they shall no more find them. The merchants of these things which are made rich, shall stand far from her for fear of her torments, weeping and mourning, &amp; saying: </div>
