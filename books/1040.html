			<div class='roleText'>Wherein hast thou loved us? Was not Esau brother to Jacob, saith our Lord, and I loved Jacob, but hated Esau? &amp; I laid his mountains into a wilderness, and his inheritance unto the dragons of the desert. But if Idumea shall say: We are destroyed, but returning we will build the things that are destroyed: thus saith the Lord of hosts: These shall build, and I will destroy: and they shall be called the borders of impiety, and the people with whom our Lord is angry for ever. And your eyes shall see: and you shall say: Our Lord be magnified upon the border of Israel. The son honoureth the father, and the servant his Lord: if then I be the father, where is my honour? And if I be the Lord, where is my fear: saith the Lord of hosts? To you o Priests, that despise my name, &amp; have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Wherein have we despised thy name? You offer upon mine altar polluted bread: &amp; you say: Wherein have we polluted thee? In that you say: The table of our Lord is contemptible. If you offer the blind to be immolated, is it not evil? &amp; if you offer the lame and the feeble is it not evil? Offer it to thy prince if it shall please him, or if he will receive thy face, saith the Lord of hosts. And now beseech ye the face of God, that he may have mercy on you (for by your hand hath this been done) if by any means he will receive your faces, saith the Lord of hosts. Who is there among you, that will shut the doors, &amp; will kindle fire on my altar for naught? I have no will in you, saith the Lord of hosts: and gift I will not receive of your hand. For from the rising of the sun even to the going down, great is my name among the Gentiles, and in every place there is sacrificing, and there is offered to my name a clean oblation: because my name is great among the Gentiles, saith the Lord of hosts. And you have polluted it in that you say: The table of our Lord is contaminated: &amp; that which is laid thereupon, is contemptible with the fire that devoureth it: And you have said: </div>

Cursed is the deceitful, that hath in his flock a male, &amp; making a vow immolateth the feeble to our Lord: because I am a great King, saith the Lord of hosts, and my name is dreadful among the Gentiles.</div>
