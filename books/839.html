			<div class='roleText'>Praise o barren woman which bearest not: sing praise, and make joyful noise, which didst not bear: because many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband, saith our Lord. Enlarge the place of thy tent, and stretch out the skins of thy tabernacles, spare not: make long thy cords, and fasten thy nails. For thou shalt penetrate to the right hand, and to the left: and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, &amp; shall inhabit the desolate cities. Fear not, because thou shall not be confounded, nor blush: for thou shalt not be ashamed, because thou shalt forget the confusion of thy youth, and the reproach of thy widowhood thou shalt remember no more. Because he shall rule over thee that made thee, the Lord of hosts is his name: &amp; thy redeemer the holy one of Israel, shall be called the God of all the earth. For as a woman forsaken &amp; mourning in spirit hath our Lord called thee, &amp; as a wife cast off from her youth, hath thy God said: For a moment, a little while have I forsaken thee, &amp; in great mercies will I gather thee. In a moment of indignation have I hid my face a little while from thee, &amp; in mercy everlasting have I had mercy on thee, said thy redeemer our Lord. As in the days of Noe is this thing to me, to whom I sware, that I would no more bring in the waters of Noe upon the earth: so have I sworn not to be angry with thee, and not to rebuke thee. For the mountains shall be moved, &amp; the little hills shall tremble; but my mercy shall not depart from thee, &amp; the covenant of my peace shall not be moved, said our Lord thy miseratour. Poor little one shaken with tempest, without all comfort, behold I will lay thy stones in order, &amp; will found thee in sapphires, &amp; I will put the jasper stone for thy munitions: &amp; thy gates into graven stones, all thy borders into stones worthy to be desired. All thy children taught of our Lord: &amp; a multitude of peace to thy children. And in justice thou shalt be founded: depart far from calumny, because thou shalt not fear: and from dread, because it shall not approach to thee. Behold, the borderer shall come, which was not with me, thy stranger sometime shall be joined to thee. Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the fire, &amp; bringeth forth a vessel for his work, &amp; I created the killer to destroy. Every vessel that is made against thee, shall not prosper: and every tongue resisting thee in judgement, thou shalt judge. This is the inheritance of the servants of our Lord, and their justice with me, saith our Lord.</div>
