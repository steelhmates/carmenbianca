			<div class='roleText'>Which things when Adonisedec king of Jerusalem had heard, to wit, that Josue had taken Hai, and had subverted it (for as he had done to Jericho and the king thereof, so did he to Hai and their king) and that the Gabaonites were fled to Israel, and were their confederates, he was sore afraid. For Gabaon was a great city, and one of the kingly cities, and greater than the town of Hai, and all their men of war most valiant. Therefore Adonisedec king of Jerusalem sent to Oham king of Hebron, and to Pharam king of Jerimoth, to Japhia also king of Lachis, and to Dabir king of Eglon, saying: Come up to me, and bring aid, that we may overcome Gabaon, because it revolted to Josue, and to the children of Israel. Therefore the five kings of the Amorrheites being assembled went up: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon, together with their hosts, &amp; camped about Gabaon, assaulting it. But the inhabitants of the city Gabaon which was besieged, sent to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him: withdraw not thy hands from the help of thy servants: come up quickly &amp; deliver us, and bring aid: for there are assembled against us all the kings of the Amorrheites, which dwell in the mountains, And Josue went up from Galgal, &amp; all the host of the men of war with him most valiant men. And our Lord said to Josue: Fear them not: for I have delivered them into thy hands: none of them shall be able to resist thee. Josue therefore came in upon them suddenly, going up all the night from Galgal. And our Lord troubled them at the sight of Israel: and destroyed them with a great slaughter in Gabaon, &amp; pursued them by the way of the ascent of Beth-horon, &amp; struck them unto Azeca &amp; Maceda. And when they fled the children of Israel, and were in the descent of Beth-horon, our Lord sent upon them great stones from heaven as far as Azeca: and there died far more with the stones of hail, than they whom the children of Israel had strucken with the sword. Then spake Josue to our Lord in the day, that he delivered the Amorrhite in the sight of Israel, &amp; said before them: Thou sun against Gabaon move not, and thou Moon against the valley of Aialon. And the Sun &amp; Moon stood still, till the people revenged themselves of their enemies. Is not this written in the book of the just? The Sun therefore stood still in the midst of heaven, &amp; hastened not to go down the space of one day. There was not before nor after so long a day, our Lord obeying the voice of a man, and fighting for Israel. And Josue returned with all Israel into the camp of Galgal. For the five kings were fled, and had hid themselves in a cave of the city of Maceda. And it was told Josue that the five kings were found lying hid in a cave of the city of Maceda. Who commanded them saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Roll great stones into the mouth of the cave, and set industrious men, which may keep them shut in: and stand not you still, but pursue the enemies, and kill all the hindermost of them that fly, neither let them enter into the forts of their cities, whom our Lord God hath delivered into your hands. The adversaries therefore being slain with a great slaughter, and almost consumed to utter destruction, they that could escape from Israel entered into fenced cities. And all the host returned to Josue in Maceda, where then the camp was, safe and the full number: and no man durst once mutter against the children of Israel. And Josue commanded, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Open the mouth of the cave, &amp; bring forth to me the five kings, that lie hid therein. And the ministers did as it was commanded them: and they brought to him the five kings out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jerimoth, the king of Lachis, the king of Eglon. And when they were brought forth to him, he called all the men of Israel, and said to the princes of the host that were with him: Go, and set your feet upon the necks of these kings. Who when they had gone, &amp; trodden with their feet the necks of them lying under, again he said to them: Fear ye not, neither dread, take courage and be strong: for so will our Lord do to all your enemies, against whom you fight. And Josue struck, and slew them, and hanged them upon five gibbets: and they hung until evening. And when the sun was down, he commanded the soldiers to take them down from the gibbets. Who cast them being taken down into the cave, wherein they had lien hid, and put on the mouth thereof great stones, which continue until this present. The same day Josue took Maceda and struck it in the edge of the sword, and killed the king and all the inhabitants thereof: he left not in it so much as small relics. And he did to the king of Maceda, as he had done to the king of Jericho. and he passed with all Israel from Maceda unto Lebna, &amp; fought against it: which our Lord delivered with the king thereof into the hands of Israel: &amp; they struck the city in the edge of the sword, &amp; all the inhabitants thereof. They left not in it any remains. And they did to the king of Lebna, as they had done to the king of Jericho. From Lebna he passed unto Lachis with all Israel: &amp; placing the host round about assaulted it. And our Lord delivered Lachis into the hands of Israel, and he took it the day following, and struck it in the edge of the sword, and every soul that was in it, as he had done to Lebna. At that time went up Horam the king of Gazer, to aid Lachis: whom Josue struck with all his people to utter destruction. And he passed from Lachis unto Eglon, &amp; compassed it, and won it the same day: and struck in the edge of the sword all the souls that were in it, according to all things that he had done to Lachis. He went up also with all Israel from Eglon unto Hebron, and fought against it: took it, &amp; struck it in the edge of the sword, the king also thereof, and all towns of that country, &amp; all the souls that remained in it: he left not therein any remains: as he had done to Eglon, so did he also to Hebron, all things that he found in it consuming with the sword. Thence returning unto Dabir, he took it, and wasted it: the king also thereof and all towns round about he struck in the edge of the sword: he left not in it any remains: as he had done to Hebron &amp; Lebna and to their kings, so did he to Dabir and the king thereof. Josue therefore struck all the hilly country &amp; south and champion, and Asedoth with their kings: he left not in it any relics, but every thing that could breathe he slew, as our Lord the God of Israel had commanded him, from Cadesbarne unto Gaza. All the Land of Gosen unto Gabaon, and all their kings, and countries he took and wasted at one assault: for our Lord the God of Israel fought for him. And he returned with all Israel to the place of the camp in Galgal.</div>
