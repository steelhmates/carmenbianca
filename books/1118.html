			<div class='roleText'>AND when the Sabboth was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary of James, and Salome bought spices, that coming they might anoint JESUS. And very early the first of the Sabboths, they come to the monument, the sun being now risen. And they said one to another: Who shall roll us back the stone from the door of the monument? And looking, they saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great. And entering into the monument, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand covered with a white robe: and they were astonished. Who saith to them: Be not dismayed; you seek JESUS of Nazareth, that was crucified; he is risen, he is not here, behold the place where they laid him. But go, tell his Disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee; there you shall see him, as he told you. But they going forth, fled from the monument. For trembling and fear had invaded them: and they said nothing to anybody, for they were afraid. And he rising early the first of the Sabboth, appeared first to Mary Magdalen, out of whom he had cast seven devils. She went and told them that had been with him, that were mourning &amp; weeping. And they hearing that he was alive and had been seen of her, did not believe. And after this he appeared in another shape to two of them walking, as they were going into the country. And they going told the rest: neither them did they believe. Last he appeared to those eleven as they sat at the table; and he exprobrated their incredulity and hardness of heart, because they did not believe them that had seen him risen again. And he said to them: Going into the whole world preach the Gospel to all creatures. He that believeth and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth not, shall be condemned. And them that believe^ these signs shall follow: In my name shall they cast out devils; They shall speak with new tongues; Serpents shall they take away; And if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; They shall impose hands upon the sick and they shall be whole. And so our Lord JESUS after he spake unto them, was assumpted into Heaven, and sat on the right hand of God. But they going forth preached every-where: our Lord working withal, and confirming the word with signs that followed.</div>
