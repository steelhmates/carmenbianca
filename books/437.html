If it please thee therefore, let us go before, and let the families follow softly after us, together with thy wife, and with the beasts. And when this pleased him that they should go, Raphael said to Tobias: Take with thee of the gall of the fish: for it shall be necessary. Tobias therefore took of that gall and they departed.

And immediately anoint upon his eyes of this gall of the fish, which thou carriest with thee. For know thou that forthwith his eyes shall be opened, and thy father shall see the light of heaven, and shall rejoice in the sight of thee. Then ran the dog before, which had been with them in the way, and coming as it were a messenger with the fawning of his tail rejoiced. And his father that was blind rising up began to run stumbling with his feet: and giving a servant his hand, went to meet his son. And receiving him kissed him, with his wife, and they began both to weep for joy. And when they had adored God, and given thanks, they sat down together. Then Tobias taking of the gall of the fish, anointed his father's eyes. And he stayed as it were almost half an hour: and the white blemish began to come out of his eyes, as it were the skin of an egg. Which Tobias taking drew from his eyes, and immediately he received sight. And they glorified God, to wit, himself and his wife, and all that knew him. And Tobias said: </div>

After seven days also came in Sara his son's wife, &amp; all the family safe, &amp; cattle, &amp; the camels, and much money of his wife's: and that money also, which he had received of Gabelus: and he told his parents all the benefits of God, which he had done to him by the man that conducted him. And Achior and Nabath^ Tobias' sister's sons came, rejoicing at Tobias, and congratulating him for all good things that God had shewed towards him. And for seven days making good cheer, they rejoiced all with great joy.</div>
