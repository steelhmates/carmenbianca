			<div class='roleText'>And Josaphat his son reigned for him, and grew strong against Israel. And he appointed numbers of soldiers in all the cities of Juda, that were compassed with walls. And he placed garrisons in the land of Juda, &amp; in the cities of Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken. And our Lord was with Josaphat, because he walked in the first ways of David his father: and he trusted not in Baalim, but in the God of his father, &amp; went forward in his precepts, and not according to the sins of Israel. And our Lord confirmed the Kingdom in his hand, and all Juda gave gifts to Josaphat: and there grew to him infinite riches, and much glory. And when his heart had taken courage for the ways of our Lord, he took away also the Excelses and groves out of Juda. And in the third year of his Kingdom, he sent of his Princes Benhail, and Abdias, and Zacharias, and Nathanael, and Micheas, that they should teach in the cities of Juda: and with them Levites, Semeias, &amp; Nathanias, and Zabadias, Asael also, and Semiramoth, and Jonathan, and Adonias, and Tobias, and Thobadonias Levites, and with them Elisama, and Joram Priests. And they taught the people in Juda, having the book of the law of our Lord: and they went about all the cities of Juda, and instructed the people. Therefore the dread of our Lord came upon all the Kingdoms of the lands, that were round about Juda, neither durst they make battle against Josaphat. Yea and the Philistians brought gifts to Josaphat, and tribute of silver, the Arabians also brought cattle, of rams seven thousand seven hundred, and buck goats as many. Josaphat therefore grew, &amp; was magnified on high: and he built in Juda houses like to towers, and walled cities. And he prepared many works in the cities of Juda: there were also men of war, and valiant in Jerusalem, of whom this is the number by the houses and families of every one: In Juda Princes of the army, Ednas duke, and with him most valiant men three hundred thousand. After him Johanan the Prince, and with him two hundred eighty thousand. After him also Amasias the son of Zechri, consecrated to our Lord, and with him two hundred thousand of valiant men. Him followed Eliada valiant to battles, and with him of them that held bow and shield two hundred thousand. After this man also Jozabad, and with him an hundred eighty thousand ready soldiers. All these were at the hand of the king, beside others, whom he had put in walled cities, in all Juda.</div>
