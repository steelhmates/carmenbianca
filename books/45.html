And he lifted up his voice with weeping, which the Aegyptians heard, and all the house of Pharao. And he said to his Brethren: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Aegypt. Be not afraid, neither let it seem to you a hard case that you did sell me into these countries: for God sent me before you into Aegypt for your preservation. For it is two years since the famine began to be upon the earth, and yet five years remain, wherein there can be neither earing nor reaping. And God sent me before, that you may be preserved upon the earth, and may have victuals to live. Not by your counsel, but by the will of God was I sent hither: who hath made me as it were a father to Pharao, and lord of his whole house, and Prince in all the land of Aegypt. Make haste and get ye up to my father, and you shall say to him: Thy son Joseph willeth thus: God hath made me lord of the whole land of Aegypt: come down to me, tarry not. And thou shalt dwell in the land of Gessen: and thou shalt be near me thou and thy sons, and thy son's children, thy sheep, and thy herds, and all things that thou dost possess. And there I will feed thee (for yet there are five years of famine remaining) lest both thou perish and thy house, and all things that thou dost possess. Behold, your eyes, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin do see, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you. Report to my father my whole glory &amp; all things that you have seen in Aegypt: make haste, and bring him to me. </div>

And Joseph kissed all his brethren, and wept upon every one: after which things they were bold to speak unto him. And it was heard of, and very famously reported abroad in the king's court: The brethren of Joseph are come: and Pharao was glad, and all his family. And he spake to Joseph that he should command his brethren, saying: </div>

Neither do you leave any thing of your household stuff: for all the riches of Aegypt shall be yours. </div>
