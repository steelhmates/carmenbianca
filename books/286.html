			<div class='roleText'>And it was told Joab, that the king wept, and mourned for his son: And the victory was turned into mourning that day to all the people: for the people heard it said in that day: The king sorroweth upon his son. And the people shunned that day to enter into the city, as a people turned, &amp; flying out of battle is wont to shrink aside. Moreover the king covered his head, and cried with a loud voice: O my son Absalom, o Absalom my son, o my son. Joab therefore entering in to the king, into his house, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Thou hast confounded this day the countenances of all thy servants, that have saved thy life, and the life of thy sons, and thy daughters, and the life of thy wives, and the life of thy concubines. Thou lovest them that hate thee, and thou hatest them that love thee: and thou hast shewed this day that thou carest not for thy nobles, and for thy servants: and indeed I know now, that if Absalom lived, and all we had been slain, then it would please thee. Now therefore arise, and come forth, and speaking unto them satisfy thy servants: for I swear to thee by our Lord, that if thou wilt not go forth, not one verily will remain with thee this night: and this shall be worse for thee, than all the evils which have come upon thee from thy youth until this present. The king therefore arose and sat in the gate: and it was told all the people that the king sat in the gate: and all the multitude came forth before the king, but Israel fled into their tabernacles. All the people also strove in all the tribes of Israel, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The king hath delivered us out of the hand of our enemies, he hath saved us from the hand of the Philistians: and now he fled out of the land for Absalom. But Absalom whom we anointed over us, is dead in the battle: how long are you still, and reduce not the king? But king David sent to Sadoc and Abiathar the Priests, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why come you last to bring back the king into his house? (And the saying of all Israel was come to the king in his house.) You are my brethren, you my bone, and my flesh, why do you last bring back the king? And say ye to Amasa: Art not thou my bone, and my flesh? These things do God to me, and these add he, if thou be not the chief captain of warfare before me always for Joab. And he inclined the heart of all the men of Juda, as it were of one man: and they sent to the king, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Return thou, and all thy servants. And the king returned, and came as far as Jordan, and all Juda came as far as Galgal to meet the king, and to bring him over Jordan. And Semei the son of Gera the son of Jemini of Bahurim made haste, and went down with the men of Juda to meet king David, with a thousand men of Benjamin, and Siba the servant of the house of Saul: and his fifteen sons, &amp; twenty servants were with him; &amp; rushing into Jordan, passed the fords before the king, that they might help over the king's household, and do according to his commandment. And Semei the son of Gera prostrate before the king, when he had now passed Jordan, said to him: Impute not to me my lord the iniquity, nor remember the injuries of thy servant in the day that thou my lord king wentest out of Jerusalem, nor put it in thy heart o king. For I thy servant acknowledge my sin: and therefore this day I am first come of all the house of Joseph, and am descended to meet my lord the king. But Abisai the son of Sarvia answering, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What is to me and you ye sons of Sarvia? Why are you made this day as satan to me? Shall there a man be killed in Israel today? Do I not know that this day I am made king over Israel? And the king said to Semei: Thou shalt not die. And he sware to him. Miphiboseth also the son of Saul came down to meet the king, his feet unwashed, and his beard not polled: and he had not washed his garments from the day that the king went forth, until the day of his return in peace. And when he had met the king at Jerusalem, the king said to him: Why camest thou not with me Miphiboseth? And he answering, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>My lord king, my servant contemned me: and I thy servant spake to him that he should saddle me an ass, that getting on I might go with the king: for I thy servant am lame. Moreover he hath also accused me thy servant to thee my lord king: but thou my lord king art as an Angel of God, do what pleaseth thee. For neither was my father's house ought else, but guilty of death to my lord king: and thou hast put me thy servant among the guests of thy table? What just complaint therefore have I? Or what can I further cry out to the king? The king therefore said to him: What speakest thou any more? That is determined which I have spoken: Thou and Siba divide the possessions. And Miphiboseth answered the king: Yea let him take all, for so much as my lord king is returned peaceably into his house. Berzellai also the Galaadite, coming down from Rogelim, brought the king over Jordan, being ready also to attend on him beyond the river. And Berzellai the Galaadite was very old, that is to say, of four score years, and he gave the king victuals, when he abode in the field: for he was an exceeding rich man. The king therefore said to Berzellai: Come with me, that thou mayest rest secure with me in Jerusalem. And Berzellai said to the king: How many are the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king into Jerusalem? I am this day four score years old, are my senses quick to discern sweet or sour? Or can meat or drink delight thy servant? Or can I hear more the voice of singing men and singing women? Why should thy servant be a burden to my lord the king? I thy servant will go forward a little from Jordan with thee: I need not this recompense, but I beseech thee that I thy servant may return, and die in my city, and be buried by the sepulchre of my father, and my mother. But there is thy servant Chamaam, let him go with thee, my lord king, and do to him whatsoever seemeth good to thee. The king therefore said to him: Let Chamaam pass on with me, and I will do for him whatsoever shall please thee, and all that thou shalt ask of me, thou shalt obtain. And when all the people and the king had passed Jordan, the king kissed Berzellai, and blessed him: and he returned into his place. The king therefore passed into Galgal, and Chamaam with him, and all the people of Juda had brought over the king, and the half part only of the people of Israel were present. Therefore all the men of Israel concurring to the king, said to him: why have our brethren the men of Juda stolen thee, and brought the king and his household over Jordan, and all the men of David with him? And every man of Juda answered the men of Israel: Because the king is nearer to me: why art thou angry for this matter? Have we eaten any thing of the king's, or were there gifts given us? And a certain man of Israel answered the men of Juda, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I am greater by ten parts with the king, and to me pertaineth David more than to thee: Why hast thou done me wrong, and it was not told me first, that I might bring back my king? And the men of Juda answered more sharply than the men of Israel.</div>
