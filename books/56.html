			<div class='roleText'>I am the Lord, that appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty: and my name ADONAI I did not shew them. And I made a covenant with them, to give them the Land of Chanaan, the land of their pilgrimage, wherein they were strangers. And I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel, wherewith the Aegyptians have oppressed them: &amp; I have remembered my covenant. Therefore say to the children of Israel: I^ the Lord who will bring you forth out of the work-prison of the Aegyptians, and will deliver you from servitude: and redeem you in a high arm, and great judgments. And I will take you to me for my people, and I will be your God: and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, that brought you forth out of the work-prison of the Aegyptians: and brought you into the land, over which I lifted up my hand to give it to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and I will give it you to possess: I^ the Lord. </div>

These are Princes of their houses by their families. The sons of Ruben the first-begotten of Israel: Henoch and Phallu, Hesron and Charmi. These are the kindreds of Ruben. The sons of Simeon: Iamuel and Jamin, and Ahod, and Jachin, and Soar, and Saul the sons of the Chananitess, these are the progenies of Simeon. And these are the names of the sons of Levi by their kindreds: Gerson and Caath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were an hundred thirty seven. The sons of Gerson: Lobni and Semi, by their kindreds. The sons of Caath: Amram, and Isaar, and Hebron and Oziel. The years also of Caath's life, were an hundred thirty three. The sons of Merari: Moholi and Musi, these be the kindreds of Levi by their families. And Amram took to wife Iocabed his aunt by the father's side: who bare him Aaron &amp; Moyses. And the years of Amram's life were an hundred thirty seven. The sons also of Isaar: Core, &amp; Nepheg, &amp; Zechri. The sons also of Oziel: Mizael, &amp; Elizaphan, &amp; Sethri.
