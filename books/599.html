			<div class='roleText'>A prayer to David himself. Incline thine ear, o Lord, &amp; hear me: because I am needy and poor. Keep my soul, because I am holy: save thy servant my God, that hopeth in thee. Have mercy on me, o Lord, because I have cried to thee all the day: make joyful the soul of thy servant, because to thee, o Lord, have I lifted up my soul. Because thou, o Lord, art sweet, and mild: and of much mercy to all that invocate thee. Receive, o Lord, my prayer with thine ears: and attend to the voice of my petition. In the day of my tribulation I have called to thee: because thou hast heard me. There is not the like to thee amongst gods, o Lord: and there is not according to thy works. All nations whatsoever thou hast made, shall come, and shall adore before thee, o Lord: and they shall glorify thy name. Because thou art great and doing marvelous things: thou only art God. Conduct me, o Lord, in thy way, and I will walk in thy truth: let my heart rejoice that it may fear thy name. I will confess to thee, o Lord my God, with all my heart, and will glorify thy name for ever. Because thy mercy is great upon me: &amp; thou hast delivered my soul out of the lower hell. O God the wicked are risen up upon me, and the synagogue of the mighty have sought my soul: and they have not set thee in their sight. And thou, o Lord, the God of compassion and merciful, patient, and of much mercy, and true. Have respect to me and have mercy on me, give thine empire to thy servant: and save the son of thy handmaid. Make with me a sign unto God, that they may see which hate me, and may be confounded: because thou o Lord hast holpen me.</div>
