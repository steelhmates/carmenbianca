			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for Maeleth, understandings of David. The fool hath said in his heart: There is no God. They are corrupt, and become abominable in iniquities: there is not that doth good. God hath looked forth from heaven, upon the children of men: to see if there be that understandeth, or seeketh after God. All have declined, they are become unprofitable together: there is not that doth good, no there is not one. Shall they not all know that work iniquity, that devour my people as food of bread? God they have not invocated: there have they trembled for fear, where no fear was. Because God hath dissipated the bones of them that please men: they are confounded, because God hath despised them. Who will give out of Sion the salvation of Israel? When God shall convert the captivity of his people: Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.</div>
