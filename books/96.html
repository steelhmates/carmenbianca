			<div class='roleText'>The soul that shall sin, and contemning the Lord, shall deny unto his neighbour the thing delivered to his custody, which was committed to his credit, or shall by force extort any thing, or do oppression, or shall find a thing lost, and denying it, be also forsworn, and shall do any other thing of many, wherein men are wont to sin, being convicted of the offence, he shall render all things which by fraud he would have obtained, whole, and the fifth part besides to the owner unto whom he did the damage. But for his sin he shall offer a ram without spot out of the flock, and shall give it to the Priest, according to the estimation and measure of the offence: who shall pray for him before the Lord, and he shall have forgiveness for every thing that in doing he sinned. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Command Aaron and his sons: This is the Law of an holocaust: It shall be burnt upon the altar, all night until morning: the fire shall be upon the same altar. The Priest shall be revested with the tunic and the linen femorals: and he shall take up the ashes, which the devouring fire burned, and putting them besides the altar, shall be unvested of his former vestments, and being clothed with others, shall carry them forth, without the camp, and in a most clean place shall cause them to be consumed unto dust. And the fire on the altar shall always burn, which the Priest shall nourish, putting wood underneath, in the morning every day, and laying on the holocaust, thereupon shall burn the fat of the pacifics. This fire is continual which shall never fail on the altar. This is the Law of the sacrifice and libaments, which the children of Aaron shall offer before the Lord, and before the altar. The Priest shall take up a handful of the flour, that is tempered with oil, and all the frankincense, that is put upon the flour: and he shall burn it on the altar for a monument of most sweet odour to the Lord: and the part of the flour that is left, shall Aaron eat with his sons, without leaven: and he shall eat it in the Holy place of the court of the tabernacle. And therefore it shall not be leavened, because part thereof is offered for the burnt sacrifice of the Lord. It shall be most Holy, as that for sin, and for offence. The males only of Aaron's stock shall eat it. It shall be an ordinance and everlasting in your generations of the sacrifices of the Lord. Every one that toucheth them, shall be sanctified. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This is the oblation of Aaron, and of his sons, which they must offer to the Lord, in the day of their unction. The tenth part of an ephi of flour shall they offer in a sacrifice for ever, half thereof in the morning, and half thereof at even: which being tempered with oil shall be fried in a frying pan. And the Priest that by right succeedeth his father, shall offer it hot, for a most sweet odour to the Lord, and it shall wholly be burnt on the altar. For every sacrifice of the Priest shall be consumed with fire, neither shall any man eat thereof. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Speak to Aaron and his sons: This is the law of the host for sin. In the place where the holocaust is offered, shall it be immolated before our Lord. It is Holy of holies. The Priest that doth offer it, shall eat it in a holy place, in the court of the tabernacle. Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof, shall be sanctified. If of the blood thereof a garment be sprinkled, it shall be washed in a holy place. And the earthen vessel, wherein it was sodden, shall be broken, but if the vessel be of brass, it shall be scoured, and washed with water. Every male of the priestly race shall eat of the flesh thereof, because it is Holy of holies. For the host that is slain for sin, whose blood is carried into the tabernacle of testimony to make expiation in the Sanctuary, shall not be eaten, but shall be burnt with fire.</div>
