			<div class='roleText'>LET us fear therefore lest perhaps forsaking the promise of entering into his rest, some of you be thought to be wanting. For to us also it hath been denounced, as also to them. But the word of hearing did not profit them, not mixt with faith of those things which they heard. For we that have believed, shall enter into the rest: as he said, As I sware in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest: &amp; truly the works from the foundation of the world being perfited. For he said in a certain place of the seventh day, thus: And God rested the seventh day from all his works. And again in this, If they shall enter into my rest. Because then it remaineth that certain enter into it, and they to whom first it was preached, did not enter because of incredulity: again he limiteth a certain day: Today, in David saying, after so long time, as is above said, Today if you shall hear his voice: do not obdurate your hearts. For if Jesus had given them rest: he would never speak of another day afterward. Therefore there is left a sabbatism for the people of God. For he that is entered into his rest, the same also hath rested from his works, as God from his. Let us hasten therefore to enter into that rest: that no man fall into the same example of incredulity. For the word of God is lively and forcible, and more piercing than any two-edged sword: &amp; reaching unto the division of the soul and the spirit, of the joints also and the marrows, and a discerner of the cogitations and intents of the heart. And there is no creature invisible in his sight. But all things are naked and open to his eyes, to whom our speech is. Having therefore a great high Priest that hath entered the heavens, JESUS the Son of God, let us hold the confession. For we have not a high priest that cannot have compassion on our infirmities: but tempted in all things by similitude, except sin. Let us go therefore with confidence to the throne of grace: that we may obtain mercy, and find grace in seasonable aid.</div>
