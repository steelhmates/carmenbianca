			<div class='roleText'>AND I do you to understand, brethren, the Gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in the which also you stand, by the which also you are saved, after what manner I preached unto you if you keep it, unless you have believed in vain. For I delivered unto you first of all which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures: and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures: and that he was seen of Cephas; and after that of the eleven. Then was he seen of more than five hundred brethren together: of which many remain until this present, and some are a-sleep. Moreover he was seen of James, then of all the Apostles. And last of all, as it were of an abortive he was seen also of me. For I am the least of the Apostles, who am not worthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God. But by the grace of God I am that which I am; &amp; his grace in me hath not been void, but I have laboured more aboundantly than all they: yet not I, but the grace of God with me. For whether I, or they, so we preach, and so you have believed. But if Christ be preached that he is risen again from the dead, how do certain among you say, that there is no resurrection of the dead? And if there be no resurrection of the dead, neither is Christ risen again. And if Christ be not risen again, then vain is our preaching, vain also is your faith. And we are found also false witnesses of God: because we have given testimony against God, that he hath raised up Christ, whom he hath not raised up, if the dead rise not again. For if the dead rise not again, neither is Christ risen again. And if Christ be not risen again, vain is your faith, for yet you are in your sins. Then they also that are a-sleep in Christ, are perished. If in this life only we be hoping in Christ, we are more miserable than all men. But now Christ is risen again from the dead, the first fruits of them that sleep: for by a man death; and by a man the resurrection of the dead. And as in Adam all die, so also in Christ all shall be made alive. But every one in his own order: the first fruits Christ, then they that are of Christ, that believed in his coming. Then the end, when he shall have delivered the Kingdom to God and the Father, when he shall have abolished all principality &amp; authority &amp; power. And he must reign, Until he put all his enemies under his feet. And the enemy death shall be destroyed last. For he hath subdued all things under his feet. And whereas he saith, All things are subdued to him; undoubtedly, except him that subdued all things unto him. And when all things shall be subdued to him; then the Son also himself shall be subject to him that subdued all things unto him, that God may be all in all. Otherwise what shall they do that are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not again at all? Why also are they baptized for them? Why also are we in danger every hour? I die daily by your glory, brethren, which I have in Christ JESUS our Lord. If (according to man) I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what doth it profit me, if the dead rise not again? Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die. Be not seduced, Evil communications corrupt good manners. Awake ye just, and sin not. For some have not the knowledge of God, I speak to your shame. But some man saith: How do the dead rise again? and with what manner of body shall they come? Fool, that which thou sowest is not quickened, unless it die first. And that which thou sowest, not the body that shall be, doest thou sow; but bare grain, to wit, of wheat, or of some of the rest. And God giveth it a body as he will: &amp; to every seed his proper body. Not all flesh, is the same flesh: but one of men, another of beasts, another of birds, another of fishes. And bodies celestial, &amp; bodies terrestrial: but, one glory of the celestial, and another of the terrestrial. One glory of the sun, another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars. For star differeth from star in glory: so also the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption, it shall rise in incorruption. It is sown in dishonour, it shall rise in glory. It is sown in infirmity, it shall rise in power. It is sown a natural body; it shall rise a spiritual body. If there be a natural body, there is also a spiritual, as it is written: The first man Adam was made into a living soul: the last Adam into a quickening spirit. Yet that is not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural: afterward that which is spiritual. The first man of earth, earthly: the second man from Heaven, heavenly. Such as is the earthly, such also are the earthly: and such as the heavenly, such also are the heavenly. Therefore as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly. This I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot possess the Kingdom of God: neither shall corruption possess incorruption. Behold I tell you a mystery. We shall all indeed rise again: but we shall not all be changed. In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet (for the trumpet shall sound) and the dead shall rise again incorruptible: and we shall be changed. For this corruptible must do on incorruption; &amp; this mortal do on immortality. And when this mortal hath done on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: Death is swallowed up in victory. Death where is thy victory? Death where is thy sting? And the sting of death, is sin: and the power of sin is the Law. But thanks be to God that hath given us the victory by our Lord JESUS Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be stable and unmoveable; abounding in the work of our Lord always, knowing that your labour is not vain in our Lord:</div>
