			<div class='roleText'>And all the people was gathered together as it were one man to the street, which is before the water, &amp; they said to Esdras the scribe, that he should bring the book of the law of Moyses, which our Lord had commanded Israel. Esdras therefore the Priest brought the law before the multitude of men and women, and all that could understand, in the first day of the seventh month. And he read it plainly in the street that was before the water gate, from morning until midday, in the presence of the men, and women, &amp; of those that understood: &amp; the ears of all the people were attent to the book. And Esdras the scribe stood upon a step of wood, which he made to speak upon: &amp; there stood by him Mathathias, &amp; Semeia, &amp; Ania, and Uria, &amp; Helcia, and Maasia, on his right hand: and on the left: Phadaia, Misael, and Melchia, and Hasum, and Hasbadana, Zacharia, and Mosollam. And Esdras opened the Book before all the people: for he appeared above all the people: and when he had opened it, all the people stood. And Esdras blessed our Lord the great God: and all the people answered: Amen, amen: lifting up their hands, and they bowed, and adored God flat on the earth. Moreover Josue, and Bani, and Serebia, Jamin, Accub, Septhai, Odia, Maasia, Celita, Azarias, Jozabed, Hanan, Phalaia: Levites, made silence in the people to hear the law: and the people stood in their degree. And they read in the Book of the law of God distinctly and plainly, for to understand: and they understood when it was read. And Nehemias said (the same is Athersatha) and Esdras the Priest and scribe, and the Levites interpreting to all the people: It is a day sanctified to the Lord our God, mourn ye not, and weep not. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law. And he said to them: Go, eat fat things, and drink the sweet wine, and send portions to them, that have not prepared for themselves, because it is the holy day of our Lord, and be not sad: for the joy of our Lord is our strength. And the Levites made silence in all the people, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hold your peace, because the day is holy, &amp; be not sorrowful. Therefore all the people went to eat and drink, and to send portions, and to make great joy: because they understood the words, that he had taught them. And in the second day were gathered the Princes of the families of all the people, the Priests and Levites to Esdras the scribe, that he should interpret unto them the words of the law. And they found written in the law, that our Lord commanded in the hand of Moyses, that the children of Israel should dwell in tabernacles, on the solemn day, the seventh month: and that they should proclaim and publish a voice in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Go ye forth into the mount, and fetch branches of the olive tree, and branches of the most fair tree, branches of the myrtle tree, &amp; boughs of the palm trees, and branches of the thick leaved tree, that tabernacles may be made, as it is written. And the people went forth, and brought. And they made themselves tabernacles every man in his house top, and in his courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of Ephraim. Therefore all the Church of them, that were returned from the captivity, made tabernacles, and dwelt in tabernacles. For from the days of Josue the son of Nun the children of Israel had not done it in such sort, until that day: and there was exceeding great joy. And he read in the book of the law of God day by day, from the first day till the last, and they made the solemnity seven days, &amp; in the eighth day a collect according to the rite.</div>
