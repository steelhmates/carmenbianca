			<div class='roleText'>AND after this our Lord designed also other seventy two: and he sent them two and two before his face into every city and place whither himself would come. And he said to them: The harvest truly is much; but the workmen few. Desire therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send workmen into his harvest. Go: Behold I send you as lambs among wolves. Carry not purse nor scrip, nor shoes; and salute nobody by the way. Into whatsoever house you enter, first say: Peace to this house. And if the son of peace be there, your peace shall rest upon him: but if not, it shall return to you. And in the same house tarry you, eating and drinking such things as they have. For the workman is worthy of his hire. Remove not from house to house. And into what city soever you enter, and they receive you, eat such things as are set before you; and cure the sick that are in it, and say to them: The Kingdom of God is come nigh upon you. And into whatsoever city you enter, and they receive you not, going forth into the streets thereof, say: The dust also of your city that cleaveth to us, we do wipe off against you. Yet this know ye that the Kingdom of God is at hand. I say to you, it shall be more tolerable for Sodom in that day, than for that city. Woe to thee Corozaim, woe to thee Beth-saida: for if in Tyre and Sidon had been wrought the miracles that have been wrought in you, they had done penance sitting in sack cloth and ashes long ago. But it shall be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgement, than for you. And thou Capharnaum that art exalted unto Heaven: thou shalt be thrust down even unto hell. He that heareth you, heareth me; and he that despiseth you, despiseth me. And he that despiseth me, despiseth him that sent me. And the Seventy-two returned with joy, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lord, the devils also are subject to us in thy name. And he said to them: I saw Satan as a lightning fall from Heaven. Behold, I have given you power to tread upon serpents, and scorpions, and upon all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall hurt you. But yet rejoice not in this, that the spirits are subject unto you; but rejoice in this, that your names are written in Heaven. In that very hour he rejoiced in spirit, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>A certain man went down from Jerusalem into Jericho, and fell among thieves, who also spoiled him, and giving him wounds went away leaving him half-dead. And it chanced that a certain Priest went down the same way; and seeing him, passed by. In like manner also a Levite, when he was near the place, and saw him, passed by. But a certain Samaritane going his journey, came near him; and seeing him, was moved with mercy. And going unto him, bound his wounds, pouring in oil and wine: and setting him upon his own beast, brought him into an inn, and took care of him. And the next day he took forth two pence, and gave to the host, and said: </div>
