			<div class='roleText'>BUT Agrippa said to Paul: Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretching forth his hand, began to make his answer: Touching all things whereof I am accused of the Jews, king Agrippa, I account myself happy for that I am to defend myself this day before thee, especially whereas thou knowest all things that are among the Jews, customs and questions: for the which cause I beseech thee, hear me patiently. And my life truly from my youth, which was from the beginning in my nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews do know: knowing me before from the beginning (if they will give testimony) that according to the most sure sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. And now for the hope of the promise that was made of God to our fathers, do I stand subject to judgement: the which, our twelve tribes serving night and day, hope to come unto. Of the which hope, o king, I am accused of the Jews. What incredible thing is it judged with you, if God raise the dead? And myself truly had thought that I ought to do against the name of JESUS of Nazareth many contrary things. Which also I did at Jerusalem, and many of the saints did I shut up in prisons, having received authority of the chief priests: and when they were put to death, I brought the sentence. And throughout all the synagogues oftentimes punishing them, I compelled them to blaspheme: and yet more mad against them, I persecuted them even unto foreign cities. Among which things whiles I went to Damascus with authority and permission of the chief priests, at mid-day, in the way, I saw (o king) from Heaven a light to have shined round about me and them that were in company with me, above the brightness of the sun. And when all we were fallen down on the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me in the Hebrew tongue: Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the prick. And I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Who are thou Lord? And our Lord answered: I am JESUS whom thou doest persecute. But rise up and stand upon thy feet: for to this end have I appeared to thee, that I may ordain thee a minister and witness of those things which thou hast seen, and of those things wherein I will appear to thee, delivering thee out of the peoples and nations unto the which now I send thee, to open their eyes, that they may be converted from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive remission of sins, and lot among the saints by the faith that is in me. Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not incredulous to the heavenly vision: but to them first that are at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and unto all the country of Jewry, and to the Gentiles did I preach that they should do penance, &amp; turn to God, doing works worthy of penance. For this cause the Jews, when I was in the temple, apprehending me, attempted meaning to kill me. But aided by the help of God, I stand until this day, testifying to small &amp; to great, saying nothing beside those things which the Prophets did speak should come to pass, &amp; Moyses; if CHRIST were passible, if the first of the resurrection from the dead, he were to shew light to the people and to the Gentiles. As he spake these things and made his answer, Festus with a loud voice said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I am not mad, most excellent Festus; but I speak words of verity &amp; sobriety. For the king knoweth of these things, to whom also I speak constantly. For I think none of these things to be unknown to him. For neither was any of these things done in a corner. Believest thou the Prophets, king Agrippa? I know that thou believest. And Agrippa said to Paul: A little thou persuadest me to become a CHRISTIAN. And Paul said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I wish of God, both in little, and in much, not only thee, but also all that hear this day, to become such as I am also, except these bands. And the king rose up, and the President, and Bernice, and they that sat by them. And going aside, they spake among themselves, saying, That this man hath done nothing worthy of death or bands. And Agrippa said to Festus: This man might be released, if he had not appealed to Caesar.</div>
