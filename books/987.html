			<div class='roleText'>As the morning passed, hath the king of Israel passed away. Because Israel was a child, and I loved him: &amp; out of Aegypt I called my son. They called them, so they departed from their face: they immolated to Baalim, and sacrificed to idols. And I as it were the nurse of Ephraim, carried them in mine arms: and they knew not that I cured them. In the cords of Adam I will draw them, in the bands of charity: and I will be to them as lifting up the yoke upon their cheeks: and I declined to him that he might eat. He shall not return into the Land of Aegypt, and Assur he his king: because they would not convert. The sword hath begun in his cities, and it shall consume his elect, and shall eat their heads. And my people shall hang upon my return: but a yoke shall be put upon them together, which shall not be taken away. How shall I give thee Ephraim, protect thee Israel? How shall I give thee as Adama, lay thee as Seboim? My heart is turned within, my repentance is disturbed together. I will not do the fury of my wrath: I will not return to destroy Ephraim: because I am God, and not man: in the midst of thee the Holy one, and I will not enter into the city. They shall walk after our Lord, as a lion will he roar: because he will roar, and the children of the sea shall fear. And they shall fly away as a bird out of Aegypt, and as a dove out of the Land of the Assyrians: and I will place them in their houses, saith our Lord. Ephraim hath compassed me in denying, and the house of Israel in deceit: but Judas a witness is descended with God, and with the saints, faithful.</div>
