			<div class='roleText'>A child of one year was Saul when he began to reign, and two years he reigned over Israel. And Saul chose to himself three thousand of Israel: and there were with Saul two thousand in Machmas, and in the mount of Bethel: and a thousand with Jonathas in Gabaa of Benjamin. Moreover the rest of the people he sent back every man into their tabernacles: And Jonathas struck the garrison of the Philisthiims, which was in Gabaa. Which when the Philisthiims had heard, Saul sounded with the trumpet in all the land, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let the Hebrews hear. And all Israel heard this manner of bruit: Saul hath strucken the garrison of the Philisthiims: &amp; Israel took courage against the Philisthiims. The people therefore cried after Saul in Galgal. And the Philisthiims were gathered together to fight against Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and the rest of the common people, as the sand which is in the sea shore very much. And going up they camped in Machmas at the East of Bethaven. Which when the men of Israel had seen themselves put in a strait (for the people was afflicted) they hid themselves in caves, and in secret places, in rocks also, and in dens, and in cisterns. And the Hebrews passed Jordan into the Land of Gad and Galaad. And when Saul was yet in Galgal, all the people was sore afraid, which followed him. And he expected seven days according to the appointment of Samuel, and Samuel came not into Galgal, and the people slipt away from him. Saul therefore said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Bring me the holocaust, and the pacifics. And he offered the holocaust. And when he had finished offering the holocaust, behold Samuel came: and Saul went forth to meet him &amp; salute him. And Samuel spake to him. What hast thou done? Saul answered: Because I saw that the people slipt from me, and thou wast not come according to the days appointed, moreover the Philisthiims were gathered together into Machmas, I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Now will the Philisthiims come down to me into Galgal, and I have not pacified the face of our Lord. Compelled by necessity, I offered the holocaust. And Samuel said to Saul: Thou hast done foolishly, neither hast thou kept the commandments of our Lord thy God, which he commanded thee. Which if thou hadst not done, even now had our Lord prepared thy Kingdom over Israel for ever, but thy Kingdom shall no farther arise. Our Lord hath sought him a man according to his heart: and him hath our Lord commanded to be Prince over his people, because thou hast not observed the things which our Lord commanded. And Samuel arose &amp; went up from Galgal into Gabaa of Benjamin. And numbered the people, which were found with him, as it were six hundred men. And Saul and Jonathas his son, and the people that were found with them, was in Gabaa of Benjamin: moreover the Philisthiims had pitched in Machmas. And there issued forth to prey from the camp of Philisthians three companies. One company went on against the way of Ephra to the Land of Saul. Moreover another went by the way of Bethhoron, and the third had turned it-self to the way of the border, in the valley Seboim against the desert. Moreover there was not found an iron smith in all the Land of Israel, for the Philisthiims had so provided, lest perhaps the Hebrews should make sword or spear. All Israel therefore went down to the Philisthiims, that every man might whet his plough coulter, and spade, and axe, and rake. Therefore the edges of the shares, and spades, and forks with three teeth, and axes were blunt, even to the goadprick, which was to be mended. And when the day was come to fight, there was not found sword and spear in the hand of all the people, that was with Saul and Jonathas, except Saul and Jonathas his son. And the station of the Philisthiims went forth, to pass up into Machmas.</div>
