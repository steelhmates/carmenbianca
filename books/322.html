			<div class='roleText'>And Eliseus the Prophet called one of the children of the Prophets, and said to him: Gird thy loins, and take this little box of oil in thy hand, and go into Ramoth Galaad. And when thou shalt come thither, thou shalt see Jehu the son of Josaphat the son of Namsi: and going in thou shalt raise him out of the midst of his brethren, and shalt bring him into an inner chamber. And holding the little box of oil, thou shalt pour upon his head, and shalt say: Thus saith our Lord: I have anointed thee king over Israel. And thou shalt open the door, and fly, and shalt not stay there. The young man therefore the child of a Prophet went into Ramoth Galaad, and entered in thither: and behold the captains of the army sat, and he said: </div>

And I will destroy all the house of Achab, and kill of Achab him that pisseth against a wall, and the shut up, and the meanest in Israel. And I will make the house of Achab as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the son of Ahias. Jezabel also the dogs shall eat in the field of Jezrahel, neither shall there be any to bury her. And he opened the door, &amp; fled. And Jehu went forth to his master's servants. Who said to him: Are all things well? Why came this mad man to thee? Who said to them: You know the man, and what he spake. But they answered: It is false, but rather do thou tell us. Who said to them: Thus and thus he spake to me: and he said: </div>

Jehu therefore the son of Josaphat the son of Namsi conspired against Joram: Moreover Joram had besieged Ramoth Galaad, he and all Israel against Hazael the king of Syria: and was returned to be cured in Jezrael of the wounds, for the Syrians had wounded him, fighting against Hazael the king of Syria.
