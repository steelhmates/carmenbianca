			<div class='roleText'>PETER an Apostle of JESUS Christ, to the elect strangers of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the prescience of God the Father, into sanctification of the Spirit, unto the obedience and sprinkling of the blood of JESUS Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied. Blessed be God and the Father of our Lord JESUS Christ, who according to his great mercy hath regenerated us unto a lively hope, by the resurrection of JESUS Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance incorruptible, and incontaminate, and that cannot fade, conserved in the heavens in you, (who in the virtue of God are kept by faith unto salvation) ready to be revealed in the last time. Wherein you shall rejoice, a little now if you must be made heavy in diverse tentations: that the probation of your faith much more precious than gold (which is proved by the fire) may be found unto praise and glory and honour in the revelation of JESUS Christ: whom having not seen, you love: in whom now also not seeing you believe: and believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and glorified, receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls. Of the which salvation the Prophets inquired &amp; searched, which prophesied of the grace to come in you, searching unto which or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them did signify: fore-telling those passions that are in Christ, and the glories following: to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to you they ministered those things which now are told you by them that have evangelized to you, the Holy Ghost being sent from Heaven, on whom the Angels desire to look. For the which cause having the loins of your mind girded, sober, trust perfectly in that grace which is offered you, in the revelation of JESUS Christ, as children of obedience, not configurated to the former desires of your ignorance: but according to him that hath called you, the Holy one, be you also in all conversation holy: because it is written: You shall be holy, because I am holy. And if you invocate the Father, him which without acception of persons judgeth according to every one's work; in fear converse ye the time of your sojourning. Knowing that not with corruptible things, gold or silver, you are redeemed from your vain conversation of your fathers' tradition: but with the precious blood as it were of an immaculate and unspotted Lamb, Christ, foreknown indeed before the constitution of the world, but manifested in the last times for you, which by him are faithful in God who raised him from the dead, &amp; hath given him glory, that your faith and hope might be in God. Making your souls chaste in obedience of charity, in the sincere love of the fraternity^ from the heart love ye one another earnestly: born again not of corruptible seed, but incorruptible by the word of God who liveth &amp; remaineth for ever. For all flesh is as grass: &amp; all the glory thereof as the flower of grass. The grass is withered, and the flower thereof is fallen away. But the word of our Lord remaineth for ever, and this is the word that is evangelized among you.</div>
