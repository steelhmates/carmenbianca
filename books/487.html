			<div class='roleText'>But Eliphaz the Themanite answering, said: Will a wise man answer as it were speaking into the wind, and fill his stomach with burning? Thou reprovest him in words, that is not equal to thee, &amp; speakest that which is not expedient for thee. As much as is in thee, thou hast evacuated fear, and hast taken away prayers before God. For thine iniquity hath taught thy mouth, and thou doest imitate the tongue of blasphemers. Thine own mouth shall condemn thee, and not I: and thy lips shall answer thee. Wast thou the first man born, and formed before the little hills? Hast thou heard God's counsel, and shall his wisdom be inferior to thee? What doest thou know, that we are ignorant of? What doest thou understand that we know not? There are both old men &amp; ancients among us, much elder than thy fathers. Is it a great matter that God should comfort thee? But thy naughty words hinder it. Why doth thy heart elevate thee, &amp; as thinking great things, hast thou astonished eyes? Why doeth thy spirit swell against God, to utter such words out of thy mouth? What is man, that he should be without spot, &amp; that the born of a woman should appear just? Behold among his saints none is immutable, &amp; the heavens are not clean in his sight. How much more is man abominable, and unprofitable, who drinketh iniquity as it were water? I will shew thee, hear me: that which I have seen I will tell thee. Wise men confess and hide not their fathers: to whom only the earth was given, and stranger hath not passed by them. The impious is proud all his days, and the number of the years of his tyranny is uncertain. The sound of terror is always in his ears: and when there is peace, he always suspecteth treason. He believeth not that he may return from darkness to light, looking round about for the sword on every side. When he shall move himself to seek bread, he knoweth that the day of darkness is prepared in his hand. Tribulation shall terrify him, and distress shall compass him, as a king that is prepared to battle. For he hath stretched his hand against God, &amp; is strengthened against the Omnipotent. He hath run against him with neck set upright, and is armed with a fat neck. Fatness hath covered his face, and from his sides there hangeth tallow. He hath dwelt in desolate cities, and in desert houses, that are brought into hillocks. He shall not be enriched, neither shall his substance continue, neither shall he put his root in the earth. He shall not depart out of darkness, the flame shall dry his boughs, and he shall be taken away with the spirit of his own mouth. He shall not believe^ vainly deceived with error, that he may be redeemed with any price. Before his days be accomplished, he shall perish: and his hands shall wither. His cluster in the first flower shall be hurt as a vine, and as the olive tree casting his flower. For the congregation of the hypocrite is barren, and fire shall devour their tabernacles, which gladly take gifts. He conceived sorrow, and hath brought forth iniquity, and his womb prepareth guiles.</div>
