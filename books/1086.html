Or have ye not read in the Law, that on Sabboth-days the Priests in the temple do break the Sabboth, &amp; are without blame? But I tell you that there is here a greater than the temple. And if you did know what it is, I will mercy, and not Sacrifice: you would never have condemned the innocents. For the Son of man is Lord of the Sabboth also. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate: and every city or house divided against itself, shall not stand. And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself: how then shall his kingdom stand? And if I in Beelzebub cast out devils, your children in whom do they cast out? Therefore they shall be your judges. But if I in the Spirit of God do cast out devils, then is the Kingdom of God come upon you. Or how can a man enter into the house of the strong, and rifle his vessels, unless he first bind the strong? and then he will rifle his house. He that is not with me, is against me: and he that gathereth not with me, scattereth. Therefore I say to you: Every sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit shall not be forgiven. And whosoever shall speak a word against the Son of man, it shall be forgiven him: but he that shall speak against the Holy-Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world, nor in the world to come. Either make the tree good, and his fruit good: or make the tree evil, and his fruit evil. For of the fruit the tree is known. You vipers' broods, how can you speak good things, whereas you are evil? For of the aboundance of the heart the mouth speaketh. A good man out of a good treasure bringeth forth good things: and an evil man out of an evil treasure bringeth forth evil things. But I say unto you, that every idle word that men shall speak, they shall render an account for it in the day of judgement. For of thy words thou shalt be justified, and of thy words thou shalt be condemned. </div>

For as Jonas was in the whale's belly three days and three nights; so shall the Son of man be in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. The men of Ninivee shall rise in the judgement with this Generation, and shall condemn it: because they did penance at the preaching of Jonas. And behold more than Jonas here. The queen of the South shall rise in the judgement with this Generation, and shall condemn it: because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Salomon, and behold more than Salomon here. And when an unclean spirit shall go out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth not. Then he saith: I will return into my house whence I came out. And coming he findeth it vacant, swept with besoms, and trimmed. Then goeth he, and taketh with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last of that man be made worse than the first. So shall it be also to this wicked Generation. </div>
