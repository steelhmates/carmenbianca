			<div class='roleText'>And thou son of man take thee a sharp knife, shaving the hairs: and thou shalt take it and draw it over thy head, and over thy beard: and thou shalt take thee a balance of weight, and shalt divide them. The third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city, according to the accomplishing of the days of the siege: and thou shalt take a third part, and cut it with the knife in the circuit thereof: but the other third part thou shalt scatter into the wind, and I will draw the sword after them: And thou shalt take thereof a small number: and shalt bind them in the skirt of thy cloak. And of them again thou shalt take, and shalt cast them forth in the midst of the fire, and shalt burn them with fire: and out of it shall come forth a fire into all the house of Israel. Thus saith our Lord God: This is Jerusalem, I placed her in the midst of the Gentiles, and countries round about her. And she hath contemned my judgements, so that she was more impious than the Gentiles: and my precepts more than the lands, that are round about her. For they have cast away my judgements, and in my precepts they have not walked. Therefore thus saith our Lord God: Because you have passed the Gentiles, that are round about you, and have not walked in my precepts, and have not done my judgements, and according to the judgements of the nations, which are round about you, you have not wrought. Therefore thus saith our Lord God: Behold I to thee, &amp; I myself will do judgements, in the midst of thee in the eyes of the Gentiles. And I will do in thee that which I have not done: &amp; the like whereof I will do no more for all thine abominations. Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers: and I will do judgements in thee, and I will scatter all thy remnant into every wind. Therefore I live, saith our Lord God: Unless for that thou hast violated my sanctuary in all thine offences, and in all thine abominations: I also do break thee, and mine eye shall not spare, and I will not have mercy. The third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee: and a third part of thee shall fall by the sword round about thee: and thy third part I will scatter into every wind, and I will draw a sword after them. And I will accomplish my fury, and will make mine indignation rest in them, and will be comforted: and they shall know that I^ the Lord have spoken in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished mine indignation in them. And I will make thee a desert, and a reproach to the nations, that are round about thee, in the sight of every one that passeth by. And thou shalt be a reproach, and blasphemy, an example, and astonishment amongst the nations, that are round about thee, when I shall have done judgments in thee in fury, and in indignation, and in the rebukes of anger. I^ the Lord have spoken: When I shall send very sore arrows of famine upon them: which shall be mortiferous, and which I shall send to destroy you: and I will gather famine upon you, and will break among you the staff of bread. And I will send in upon you famine, and very sore beasts even to destruction: and pestilence, and blood shall pass through thee, and the sword I will bring in upon thee. I^ the Lord have spoken.</div>
