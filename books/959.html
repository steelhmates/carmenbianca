			<div class='roleText'>And when you shall begin to divide the land by lot, separate ye first fruits to our Lord, a piece sanctified of the land, in length twenty five thousand, and in breadth ten thousand: it shall be sanctified in all the border thereof round about. And it shall be sanctified on every side by five hundred and five hundred, four square round about: and of fifty cubits for the suburbs thereof round about. And from this measure thou shalt measure the length, of five and twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand, and in it shall be the temple, and Sanctum Sanctorum. The sanctified piece of the land shall be for the Priests the ministers of the sanctuary, which approach to the ministry of our Lord: and it shall be a place to them for houses, and for the sanctuary of holiness. And five and twenty thousand of length, and ten thousand of breadth shall be for the Levites, which minister in the house: they shall possess twenty cells. And the possession of the city you shall give five thousand of breadth, &amp; of length five and twenty thousand, according to the separation of the sanctuary, to all the house of Israel. To the Prince also on this side &amp; on that side, according to the separation of the sanctuary, and according to the possession of the city, against the face of the separation of the sanctuary, and against the face of the possession of the city: from the side of the Sea even to the Sea, and from the side of the East even to the East. And the length according to every part from the West border to the East border. Of the land shall he have possession in Israel: &amp; the Princes shall no more spoil my people: but the land they shall give to the house of Israel according to their tribes. Thus saith our Lord God: Let it suffice you o Princes of Israel: intermit ye iniquity and robberies, and do judgement &amp; justice, separate your confines from my people, saith our Lord God. Just balance, &amp; a just ephi, &amp; a just bate shall be to you. The ephi, &amp; the bate shall be equal, and of one measure: that the bate may take the tenth part of a core, &amp; the ephi the tenth part of a core: according to the measure of a core shall be the equal balancing of them. And a sicle hath twenty oboles. Moreover twenty sicles, and five and twenty sicles, &amp; fifteen sicles make Mnam. And these are the first fruits, which you shall take: the sixth part of an ephi of a core of wheat, and the sixth part of an ephi of a core of barley. The measure of oil also, a bate of oil is the tenth part of a core: and ten bates make a core: because ten bates fill a core. And one ram of a flock of two hundred, of those things that Israel nourisheth for sacrifice, &amp; for holocaust, and for pacifics, to expiate for them, saith our Lord God. All the people of the land shall be bound to these first fruits for the Prince in Israel. And upon the Prince shall the holocaust be, and the sacrifice, and the libaments in the solemnities, and in the Calends, &amp; in the Sabbaths, &amp; in all the solemnities of the house of Israel: he shall make the sacrifice for sin, &amp; the holocaust, &amp; the pacifics to expiate for the house of Israel. Thus saith our Lord God: In the first month, the first of the month, thou shalt take a calf of the herd unspotted, and thou shalt expiate the sanctuary. And the Priest shall take of the blood that shall be for sin: and he shall put it on the posts of the house, and on the four corners of the brim of the altar, &amp; on the posts of the gate of the inner court. And so shalt thou do in the seventh of the month for every one, that hath been ignorant, and was deceived by error, and you shall expiate for the house. In the first month, the fourteenth day of the month shall be with you the solemnity of Pasch: seven days shall Azymes be eaten. And the Prince in that day shall make for himself, and for all the people of the land, a calf for sin. And in the solemnity of the seven days he shall make holocaust to our Lord seven calves, and seven rams unspotted daily seven days: and for sin a buck of goats daily. And he shall make the sacrifice an ephi to a calf, and an ephi to a ram: and of oil an hin to every ephi. In the seventh month the fifteenth day of the month, in the solemnity he shall make as are before said^ for seven days: as well for sin, as for holocaust, and in sacrifice, and in oil.</div>
