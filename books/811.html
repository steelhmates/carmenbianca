			<div class='roleText'>In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Juda. Sion the city of our strength, a Saviour therein shall be put a wall and bulwark. Open ye the gates, and let the just nation enter in, that keepeth truth. The old error is gone: thou wilt keep peace: peace, because we have hoped in thee. You have hoped in our Lord in worlds everlasting, in our Lord God strong for ever. Because he will bow down them that dwell on high, the high city he will abase. He will abase it even to the ground, he will pluck it down even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy. The path of the just is right, the path of the just is right to walk in. And in the path of thy judgements, o Lord, we have patiently expected thee: thy name, and thy memorial are in the desire of the soul. My soul hath desired thee in the night: yea and with my spirit in my heart I will watch to thee in the morning. When thou shalt do thy judgements in the earth, the inhabitants of the world shall learn justice. Let us have mercy on the impious, and he will not learn justice: in the land of the holy he hath done wicked things, and he shall not see the glory of our Lord. Lord thy hand be exalted, and let them not see: let the envious people see, and be confounded: and let fire devour thine enemies. Lord thou wilt give peace to us: for all our works thou hast wrought to us. O Lord our God, there have lords besides thee possessed us, only in thee let us remember thy name. Let not the dead live, let not the giants rise again: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed them, &amp; hast destroyed all their memory. Thou hast been favourable to the nation, o Lord, thou hast been favourable to the nation: wast thou glorified? Thou hast made all the ends of the earth far off. Lord in distress they have sought after thee, in tribulation of murmur thy doctrine was to them. As she that conceiveth, when she draweth near to be delivered, being sorrowful cryeth in her pains: so are we become at thy presence, o Lord. We have conceived, and as it were travailed, and brought forth the spirit: salvations we have not done in the earth, therefore the inhabitants of the earth have not fallen. Thy dead shall live, my slain shall rise again: awake, and praise ye that dwell in the dust: because the dew of the light is thy dew, &amp; the land of the giants thou shalt pluck down into ruin. Go my people, enter into thy chambers, shut thy doors upon thee, be hid a little for a moment, till the indignation pass. For behold our Lord will come out of his place, to visit the iniquity of the inhabitant of the earth against him: and the earth shall reveal her blood, and shall cover her slain no more.</div>
