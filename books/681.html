			<div class='roleText'>Better is a dry morsel with joy, than a house full of victims with brawling. A wise servant shall rule over foolish children, and divide inheritance among brethren. As silver is tried by fire, and gold in the furnace: so our Lord proveth the hearts. The evil man obeyeth an unjust tongue: and the deceitful obeyeth lying lips. He that despiseth the poor, upbraideth his maker: and he that rejoiceth at another man's ruin, shall not be unpunished. The crown of old men the children's children: and the glory of children their fathers. Eloquent words become not a fool, nor lying lips a Prince. A most grateful pearl, the expectation of him that expecteth: whither soever he turneth himself, he understandeth wisely. He that concealeth offence, seeketh friendships: he that in other word repeateth it, separateth the confederate. Reprehension doth more profit with a wiseman, than an hundred stripes with a fool. An evil man always seeketh brawls: but a cruel angel shall be sent against him. It is better to meet a bear when her young are taken away, than a fool trusting to himself in his own folly. He that rendereth evil things for good, evil shall not depart from his house. He that letteth water go, is the head of brawls: &amp; before he suffer contumely, he forsaketh judgment. He that justifieth the impious, and he that condemneth the just, both are abominable before God. What doth it profit a fool to have riches, whereas he cannot buy wisdom? He that maketh his house high, seeketh ruin: and he that refuseth to learn, shall fall into evils. He loveth at all time that is a friend: and a brother is proved in distresses. A foolish man will clap the hands, when he is surety for his friend. He that meditateth discords, loveth brawls: and he that exalteth the door, seeketh ruin. He that is of a perverse heart, shall not find good: and he that turneth his tongue, shall fall into evil. A fool is born to his own ignominy: but neither shall the father rejoice in a fool. A joyful mind maketh a flourishing age, a sorrowful spirit dryeth up the bones. The impious receiveth gifts out of the bosom, that he may pervert the paths of judgment. In the face of the prudent wisdom shineth: the eyes of fools are in the ends of the earth. A foolish son is the anger of the father: and the sorrow of the mother that bare him. It is not good to do hurt to the just: nor to strike the Prince, which judgeth right. He that moderateth his words, is learned and prudent: and the learned man is of a precious spirit. The fool also if he hold his peace, shall be reputed wise: and if he close his lips, a man of understanding.</div>
