			<div class='roleText'>Hear the word of our Lord ye children of Israel, because there is judgement to our Lord with the inhabitants of the land: for there is no truth, and there is no mercy, and there is no knowledge of God in the land. Cursing, and lying, and manslaughter, &amp; theft, and adultery have overflowed, &amp; blood hath touched blood. For this shall the land mourn, and every one shall be weakened that dwelleth in it, in the beast of the field, and in the fowl of the heaven: yea and the fishes of the sea shall be gathered together. But yet let not every man judge: and let not a man be rebuked: for the people are as those, that gainsay the Priest. And thou shalt fall today, and the Prophet also shall fall with thee: in the night I made thy mother hold her peace. My people have held their peace, because they had not knowledge: because thou hast repelled knowledge, I will repel thee, that thou do not the function of priesthood unto me: and thou hast forgotten the law of thy God, I also will forget thy children. According to the multitude of them so have they sinned to me: their glory I will change into ignominy. They shall eat the sins of my people, and at their iniquity shall lift up their souls. And as the people, so shall the Priest be: and I will visit their ways upon them, and their cogitations I will render to them. And they shall eat and shall not be filled: they have fornicated, &amp; have not ceased: because they have forsaken our Lord in not observing. Fornication, &amp; wine, &amp; drunkenness take away the heart. My people hath asked in their wood, &amp; their staff hath declared unto them: for the spirit of fornications hath deceived them, &amp; they have fornicated from their God. Upon the heads of mountains they did sacrifice, and upon little hills they burnt incense: under the oak, and the poplar-tree, and the terebinth, because the shadow thereof was good: therefore shall your daughters fornicate, and your spouses shall be adulteresses. I will not visit upon your daughters when they shall fornicate, and upon your spouses when they shall commit adultery: because they themselves converst with harlots, and with the effeminate they did sacrifice, and the people not understanding shall be beaten. If thou fornicate o Israel, at the least let not Juda offend: and enter ye not into Galgal, and go not up into Bethaven, neither swear ye: Our Lord liveth. Because Israel hath declined as a wanton cow: now will our Lord feed them, as a lamb in latitude. Ephraim is partaker of idols, let him alone. Their banquet is separated, with fornication they have fornicated: the protectors thereof loved to bring ignominy. The spirit hath bound him in his wings, and they shall be confounded at their sacrifices.</div>
