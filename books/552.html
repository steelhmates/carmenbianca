			<div class='roleText'>I will keep my ways, that I offend not in my tongue. I have set a guard to my mouth, when the sinner stood against me. I was dumb and humbled, and kept silence from good things: and my sorrow was renewed. My heart waxed hot within me: &amp; in my meditation a fire shall burn. I have spoken in my tongue: Lord make mine end known to me. And the number of my days what it is: that I may know what is lacking to me. Behold thou hast put my days measurable, and my substance is as nothing before thee. Doubtless all things are vanity, every man living. Surely man passeth as an image, yea and he is troubled in vain. He gathereth treasure, and knoweth not to whom he shall gather them. And now what is my expectation? Is not our Lord? And my substance is with thee. From all mine iniquities deliver me: a reproach to the foolish thou hast given me. I was dumb, and opened not my mouth, because thou didst it: Remove thy scourges from me. By the strength of thy hand I have fainted in reprehensions, for iniquity thou hast chastised man. And thou hast made his soul pine away as a spider: but vainly is every man troubled. Hear my prayer, o Lord, and my petition; with thine ears receive my tears. Keep not silence: because I am a stranger with thee, and a pilgrim, as my fathers. Forgive me, that I may be refreshed before I depart: and shall be no more.</div>
