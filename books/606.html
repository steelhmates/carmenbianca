			<div class='roleText'>Praise of Canticle to David himself in the day before the sabbath, when the earth was founded. Our Lord hath reigned, he hath put on beauty: our Lord hath put on strength, and hath girded himself. For he hath established the round world, which shall not be moved. Thy seat is prepared from that time: thou art from everlasting. The rivers o Lord have lifted up: the rivers have lifted up their voice. The rivers have lifted up their waves, above the voices of many waters. The surges of the sea are marvelous, marvelous is our Lord on high. Thy testimonies are made credible exceedingly: holiness becometh thy house, o Lord for length of days.</div>
