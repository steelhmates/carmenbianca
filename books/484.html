			<div class='roleText'>But Job answering, said: Are you then men alone, &amp; shall wisdom die with you? I also have a heart even as you, neither am I inferior to you: for who is ignorant of these things, which you know? He that is mocked of his friend as I, shall invocate God, and he will hear him: for the simplicity of the just man is scorned. The lamp contemned in the cogitations of the rich, is prepared to the time appointed. The tabernacles of robbers abound, and they provoke God boldly, whereas he hath given all things into their hands. For ask the beasts, and they shall teach thee: and the fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee. Speak to the earth, and it shall answer thee, and the fishes of the sea shall tell. Who is ignorant that the hand of our Lord hath made all these things? In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the spirit of all the flesh of man. Doth not the ear discern words, and the jaws of him that eateth, the taste? In the ancients is wisdom, and in long time prudence. With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and understanding. If he shall destroy, there is no man that can build: if he shut up a man, there is none that can open. If he hold in the waters, all things shall be dried: and if he send them forth, they shall overthrow the earth. With him is strength and wisdom: he knoweth both the deceiver, and him that is deceived. He bringeth counsellers to a foolish end, &amp; judges to astonishment. He looseth the belt of kings, &amp; girdeth their reins with a cord. He leadeth away Priests without glory, &amp; supplanteth the great men. Changing the lip of the true, and taking away the doctrine of the ancients. He poureth out contempt upon Princes, relieving them that had been oppressed. Who revealeth profound things out of darkness, and bringeth forth the shadow of death into light. Who multiplieth nations, &amp; destroyeth them, and restoreth the destroyed whole again. Who changeth the heart of the Princes of the people of the earth, and deceiveth them, that they may go in vain where is no passage. They shall grope as in the dark, and not in the light, and he shall make them go amiss as drunken men.</div>
