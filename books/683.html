			<div class='roleText'>Better is a poor man, that walketh in his simplicity, than a rich writhing his lips, and unwise. Where is no knowledge of the soul, is not good: and he that is hasty with his feet shall stumble. The folly of a man supplanteth his steps: and he boileth in his mind against God. Riches add many friends: but from the poor they also which he had are separated. A false witness shall not be unpunished: &amp; he that speaketh lies, shall not escape. Many worship the person of the mighty, and are friends of him that giveth gifts. The brethren of the poor man hate him: moreover also his friends have departed far from him. He that pursueth words only, shall have nothing: but he that is possessor of the mind, loveth his soul, and the keeper of prudence shall find good things. A false witness shall not be unpunished: and he that speaketh lies shall perish. Delicacies become not a fool: nor a servant to rule over Princes. The doctrine of man is known by patience: and his glory is to overpass unjust things. As the roaring of a lion, so also the anger of a king: and as dew upon grass, so also his cheerfulness. The sorrow of the father, a foolish son: and roofs continually dropping through, a woman full of brawling. House and riches are given of the parents: but of our Lord properly a prudent wife. Slothfulness bringeth drowsiness, and a dissolute soul shall be an hungered. He that keepeth the commandment, keepeth his soul: but he that neglecteth his way, shall die. He lendeth our Lord that hath mercy on the poor: and he will repay him the like. Nurture thy son, despair not: but to the killing of him set not thy soul. He that is impatient shall sustain damage: and when he shall take away violently, he shall add another thing. Hear counsel, and receive discipline, that thou mayst be wise in thy later ends. Many cogitations in the heart of a man: but the will of our Lord shall be permanent. A needy man is merciful: and better is the poor than the lying man. The fear of our Lord unto life: and in fullness he shall abide, without the visitation most noisome: The slothful hideth his hand under the arm-hole, neither doth he put it to his mouth. The pestilent man being whipped, the fool shall be wiser: but if thou rebuke a wiseman he will understand discipline. He that afflicteth his father, and flyeth from his mother, is ignominious and unhappy. Cease not, o son, to hear doctrine, neither be ignorant of the words of knowledge. An unjust witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the impious devoureth iniquity. Judgments are prepared for scorners: &amp; hammers striking for the bodies of fools.</div>
