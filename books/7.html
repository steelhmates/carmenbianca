			<div class='roleText'>And our Lord said to him: Get thee in, thou and all thy house into the ark; for I have seen thee just in my sight in this generation. Of all beasts that are clean, thou shalt take seven and seven, male and female: but of the beasts that are unclean two and two, male and female. Yea and of the fowls also of the air seven and seven, male and female: that seed may be saved upon the face of the whole earth. For yet a while, and after seven days I will rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights: and I will clean destroy all substance that I have made, from the face of the earth. Noe therefore did all things which our Lord had commanded him. And he was six hundred years old, when the waters of the flood flowed over the earth. And Noe entered and his sons, his wife and the wives of his sons with him into the ark, because of the waters of the flood. Of beasts also the clean and the unclean, and of fowls, and of all that moveth upon the earth. two and two went to Noe into the ark, male and female, as our Lord had commanded Noe. And after the seven days were passed, the waters of the flood flowed over the earth. In the six hundred year of the life of Noe, in the second month, in the seventeenth day of the month, all the fountains of the great depth were broken up, and the flood-gates of heaven were opened: and the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights. In the very point of that day entered Noe, and Sem, and Cham, and Japheth his sons; and his wife, and the three wives of his sons with them into the ark. they and every beast according to their kind, and all cattle in their kind, and all that moveth upon the earth according to their kind, and all fowl according to their kind, all birds, and all that fly. went to Noe into the ark, two and two of all flesh, wherein there was breath of life. And such as entered in, male and female of all flesh did enter in, as God had commanded him: and our Lord shut him in on the out side. And the flood grew forty days upon the earth: and the waters increased, and lifted up the ark on high from the earth. For they overflowed exceedingly; and filled all on the face of the earth: moreover the ark fleeted upon the waters. And the waters prevailed out of measure upon the earth; and all the high mountains under the whole heaven were covered. Fifteen cubits higher was the water above the mountains, which it covered. And all flesh was consumed that moved upon the earth, of fowl, of cattle, of beasts, and of all creepers, that creep upon the earth: all men, and all things, wherein there is breath of life on the earth, died. And he clean destroyed all substance that was upon the earth, from man even to beast, as well it that creepeth, as the fowls of the air: and they were destroyed from off the earth: but only Noe remained, and they that were with him in the ark. And the waters held on above the earth an hundred fifty days.</div>
