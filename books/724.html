			<div class='roleText'>God of my fathers, and Lord of mercy, which madest all things with thy Word, and by thy Wisdom didst appoint man, that he should have dominion of the creature, that was made by thee, that he should dispose the round world in equity and justice, and execute judgement in direction of heart: give me wisdom the assistant of thy seats, and repel me not from thy children: because I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid, a weak man and of small time, and less to the understanding of judgement and laws. And if one be perfect among the children of men, and thy wisdom be absent from him, he shall be counted for nothing. Thou hast chosen me king to thy people, and judge of thy sons and daughters: and badest me build a temple in thy holy mount, and an altar in the city of thy habitation, a similitude of thy holy tabernacle, which thou didst prepare from the beginning: and thy wisdom with thee, which knew thy works, which then also was present when thou madest the round world, and knew what was pleasing to thine eyes, and what was direct in thy precepts. Send her from thy holy heavens, and from the seat of thy greatness, that she may be with me, and may labour with me, that I may know what is acceptable with thee: for she knoweth all things &amp; understandeth, and shall conduct me in my works soberly, &amp; shall keep me with her might. And my works shall be acceptable, and I shall govern thy people justly, and shall be worthy of the seats of my father. For who of men is able to know the counsel of God? Or who can think what God will? For the cogitations of mortal men be fearful, and our providences uncertain. For the body that is corrupted burdeneth the soul, and the earthly habitation presseth down the understanding that thinketh many things. And we do hardly conjecture the things that are in the earth: and the things that are in sight, we find with labour. But the things that are in the heavens who shall search out? And thy sense who shall know, unless thou give wisdom, and send thy holy Spirit from on high: and so the paths of them that are on the earth, may be corrected, and men learn the things that please thee? For by wisdom they were healed, whosoever have pleased thee o Lord from the beginning.</div>
