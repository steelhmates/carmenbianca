			<div class='roleText'>Ephraim speaking, horror invaded Israel: &amp; he sinned in Baal, and died. And now they have added to sin: and they have made to themselves a molten of their silver as it were the similitude of idols, the whole is the work of crafts-men: to these they say: Immolate men^ adoring calves. Therefore they shall be as a morning cloud, &amp; as a morning dew passing away, as dust caught with a whirlwind out of the floor, and as smoke out of the chimney. But I^ the Lord thy God out of the Land of Aegypt: and God beside me thou shalt not know, and there is no Saviour beside me. I knew thee in the desert, in the land of wilderness. According to their pastures they were filled, and were made full: they have lifted up their heart, and have forgotten me. And I will be unto them as a lioness, as a leopard in the way of the Assyrians. I will meet them as a bear her young being violently taken away, and I will break in sunder the inner parts of their liver: and will consume them there as a lion, the beast of the field shall tear them. Perdition is thine o Israel: only in me thy help. Where is thy king? Now especially let him save thee in all thy cities: and thy judges, of whom thou saidst: Give me kings, and princes. I will give thee a king in my fury, and will take him away in mine indignation. The iniquity of Ephraim is bound together, his sin is hidden. The sorrows of a woman in travail shall come to him, he a son not wise: for now he shall not stand the confraction of the children. Out of the hand of death I will deliver them, from death I will redeem them: I will be thy death o death, thy bite will I be o hell, consolation is hidden from mine eyes. Because he shall divide between brethren: our Lord will bring a burning wind rising from the desert: and it shall dry up his veins, and shall make his fountain desolate, and he shall spoil the treasure of every vessel that is to be desired.</div>
