			<div class='roleText'>But the serpent also was more subtile than all the beasts of the earth, which our Lord God had made. Which said to the woman: Why hath God commanded you, that you should not eat of every tree of Paradise? To whom the woman answered: Of the fruit of the trees that are in Paradise we do eat: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of Paradise, God hath commanded us that we should not eat: and that we should not touch it, lest perhaps we die. And the serpent said to the woman: No, you shall not die the death. For God doth know that in what day soever you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened: and you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. The woman therefore saw that the tree was good to eat, and fair to the eyes, and delectable to behold: and she took of the fruit thereof, &amp; did eat, &amp; gave to her husband, who did eat. And the eyes of them both were opened: and when they perceived themselves to be naked, they sowed together leaves of a fig tree, and made themselves aprons. And hearing the voice of our Lord God walking in Paradise at the afternoon air, Adam hid himself, and so did his wife from the face of our Lord God, amidst the trees of Paradise. And our Lord God called Adam, and said to him: Where art thou? Who said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The woman which thou gavest me to be my fellow-companion, gave me of the tree, &amp; I did eat. And our Lord God said to the woman: Why hast thou done this? Who answered: The serpent deceived me, and I did eat. And our Lord God said to the serpent: Because thou hast done this thing, accursed art thou among all cattle, and beasts of the earth: upon thy breast shalt thou go, &amp; earth shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. I will put enmity between thee &amp; the woman, &amp; thy seed and the seed of her: she shall bruise thy head in pieces, and thou shalt lie in wait of her heel. To the woman also he said: </div>

Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat the herbs of the earth. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return to earth, of which thou wast taken: because dust thou art, and into dust thou shalt return. And Adam called the name of his wife, Eve: for because she was mother of all the living. Our Lord God also made for Adam and his wife garments of skins, and clothed them: And said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lo Adam is become as it were one of us, knowing good &amp; evil: now therefore lest perhaps he reach forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever. And our Lord God sent him out of the Paradise of pleasure, to work the earth of which he was taken. And he cast out Adam, and placed before the Paradise of pleasure Cherubins, and a flaming and a turning sword, for to keep the way of the tree of life.</div>
