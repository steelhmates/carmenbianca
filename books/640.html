			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle of Salomon. Unless our Lord build the house, they have laboured in vain that build it. Unless our Lord keep the city, he watcheth in vain that keepeth it. It is vain for you to rise before light: rise ye after ye have sitten, which eat the bread of sorrow. When he shall give sleep to his beloved: behold the inheritance of our Lord are children: the reward, the fruit of the womb. As arrows in the hand of the mighty: so are the children of them that are shaken. Blessed is the man that hath filled his desire of them: he shall not be confounded when he shall speak to his enemies in the gate.</div>
