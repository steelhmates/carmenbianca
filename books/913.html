			<div class='roleText'>PUT off Jerusalem the robe of mourning, and of thy vexation: and put on the beauty, and honor of that everlasting glory, which thou hast of God. God will clothe thee with the doublet of justice, and will put upon thy head the mitre of everlasting honour. For God will shew his brightness in thee, which is under the heaven. For thy name shall be named of God to thee for ever: The peace of justice, and honor of piety. Arise Jerusalem, and stand on high: and look about toward the East, and see thy children gathered together from the rising of the sun to the going down, in the word of the holy rejoicing at the memory of God. For they went out from thee on foot led by the enemies: but our Lord will bring them to the exalted into honour as children of the kingdom. For God hath appointed to humble every high mountain, and everlasting rocks, and to fill up valleys to be equal with the earth: that Israel may walk diligently to the honour of God. And the woods also, and every tree of sweetness have overshadowed Israel by the commandment of God. For God will bring Israel with joyfulness in the light of his majesty, with mercy, and justice, which is of him.</div>
