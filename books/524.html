			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end the psalm of David. I Trust in our Lord, how say ye to my soul: Pass over unto the mountain as a sparrow? For behold sinners have bent the bow, they have prepared their arrows in the quiver, that they may shoot in the dark, at them that be right of heart. For they have destroyed the things, which thou didst perfit: but the just what hath he done? Our Lord is in his holy temple, our Lord his seat is in heaven. His eyes have respect unto the poor: his eye-lids examine the sons of men. Our Lord examineth the just and the impious but he that loveth iniquity, hateth his own soul. He shall rain snares upon sinners: fire and brimstone, and blast of storms the portion of their cup. Because our Lord is just and hath loved justice: his countenance hath seen equity.</div>
