			<div class='roleText'>And the child Samuel ministered to our Lord before Heli, and the word of our Lord was precious in those days, there was no vision manifest. It came to pass therefore on a certain day Heli lay in his place, &amp; his eyes were become dim, neither could he see: before the lamp of God was extinguished, Samuel slept in the temple of our Lord, where the ark of God was. And our Lord called Samuel. Who answering, said: </div>

Moreover Samuel did not yet know our Lord, neither had the word of our Lord been revealed to him. And our Lord added, &amp; called Samuel yet the third time. Who rising up went to Heli, &amp; said: </div>

Heli therefore understood that our Lord called the child &amp; said to Samuel: Go, &amp; sleep: and if he shall call thee hereafter, thou shalt say: Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth. Samuel therefore went and slept in his place. And our Lord came, and stood: and he called, as he had called twice, Samuel, Samuel. And Samuel said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Speak Lord, for thy servant heareth. And our Lord said to Samuel: Behold I do a thing in Israel: which whosoever shall hear, both his ears shall tingle. In that day will I raise up against Heli all things which I have spoken touching his house: I will begin, and accomplish it. For I have foretold him that I would judge his house for ever, because of iniquity, for that he knew that his sons did wickedly, and hath not corrected them. Therefore have I sworn to the house of Heli that the iniquity of his house cannot be expiated with victims and gifts for ever. And Samuel slept until morning, and opened the doors of the house of our Lord. And Samuel feared to tell the vision unto Heli. Heli therefore called Samuel, and said: </div>

These things do God to thee, and these do he add, if thou shalt hide from me a word of all the words, which were said to thee. Samuel therefore told him all the words, and did not hide them from him. And he answered: It is our Lord: let him do that which is good in his eyes. And Samuel grew, and our Lord was with him, and there fell not of his words upon the ground. And all Israel knew from Dan to Bersabee, that faithful Samuel was the Prophet of our Lord. And our Lord added to appear in Silo, because our Lord had been revealed to Samuel in Silo, according to the word of our Lord. And the word of Samuel came to pass to all Israel.</div>
