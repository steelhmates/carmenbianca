			<div class='roleText'>Moreover of hyacinth and purple, scarlet and silk he made the vestures, that Aaron should wear when he ministered in the holy places, as our Lord commanded Moyses. He made therefore an Ephod of gold, hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and twisted silk, with embroidered work, and he did cut thin plates of gold, and drew them small into threads, that they might be twisted with the woof of the former colours, and two edges coupled one to the other in the top on either side, and a bawdrike of the same colours, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. He prepared also two Onyx stones, fast set and closed in gold, &amp; graven by the art of a lapidary, with the names of the children of Israel: &amp; he set them in the sides of the Ephod for a monument of the children of Israel, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. He made also a Rationale with embroidered work according to the work of the Ephod, of gold, hyacinth, purple, and scarlet twice dyed, &amp; twisted silk: four square, double, of the measure of a palm. And he set four rews of precious stones. In the first rew was sardius, topazius, an emerald. In the second, a carbuncle, a sapphire, and a jasper. In the third, a ligurius, an achates, and an amethyst. In the fourth a chrysolith, an onyx, and berillus, compassed &amp; enclosed in gold by their rews. And the twelve stones themselves were graven with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, every one with his several name. They made also in the rationale little chains linked one to another of the purest gold, and two hooks, and as many rings of gold. Moreover the rings they set on either side of the Rationale, on the which the two golden chains should hang, which they put into the hooks, that stood out in the corners of the Ephod. These both before and behind did so agree with themselves, that the Ephod and the Rationale might be knit one to the other, tied to the bawdrike &amp; with rings strongly coupled, which a lace of hyacinth joined, lest they should flag loosely, and be moved one from the other, as our Lord commanded Moyses. They made also the tunic of the Ephod all of hyacinth, and a hole for the head in the upper part against the midst, and the border of the hole round about woven: and beneath at the feet pomegranates of hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and twisted silk: and little bells of the purest gold, which they did put between the pomegranates in the utmost part of the tunic round about: to wit, a bell of gold, &amp; a pomegranate, wherewith the high-Priest went adorned, when he executed his ministry, as our Lord had commanded Moyses: They made also silken tunics with woven work for Aaron and his sons: and mitres with their little crowns of silk: Linen breeches also, of fine linen: &amp; a girdle of twisted silk, hyacinth, purple, &amp; scarlet twice dyed, with the art of embroidering, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. They made also the plate of sacred veneration of most pure gold, &amp; they wrote in it with the work of a lapidary: The Holy of our Lord: and they tied it to the mitre with a lace of hyacinth, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. Therefore all the work of the tabernacle &amp; of the roof of testimony was perfected: &amp; the children of Israel did all things which our Lord had commanded Moyses. And they offered the tabernacle &amp; the roof &amp; the whole furniture, rings, boards, bars, pillars and their feet, the cover of rams' skins dyed red, and the other cover of janthine skins, the veil, the ark, the bars, the propitiatory, the table with the vessels thereof and the loaves of proposition: the candlestick, the lamps, and the furniture of them with the oil: the altar of gold, and the ointment, and the incense of spices: and the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle: the altar of brass, the grate, the bars, and all the vessels thereof: the laver with the foot thereof: the hangings of the court, and the pillars with their feet: the hanging in the entry of the court, and the little cords, and the pins thereof. Nothing wanted of the vessels, that was commanded to be made for the ministry of the tabernacle, and for the roof of covenant. The vestments also, which the priests use in the Sanctuary, to wit, Aaron and his sons, the children of Israel offered, as our Lord had commanded. Which things after that Moyses saw all finished, he blessed them.</div>
