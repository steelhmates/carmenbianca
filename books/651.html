			<div class='roleText'>To David himself. I will confess to thee, o Lord, in my whole heart: because thou hast heard the words of my mouth. In the sight of Angels I will sing to thee: I will adore toward thy holy temple, and will confess to thy name: For thy mercy, and thy truth: because thou hast magnified above every thing thy holy name. In what day soever I shall invocate thee, hear me: thou wilt multiply strength in my soul. Let all the kings of the earth, o Lord, confess to thee: because they have heard all the words of thy mouth: And let them sing in the ways of our Lord: because great is the glory of our Lord. Because our Lord is high, and he beholdeth low things: and high things he knoweth far off. If I shall walk in the midst of tribulation, thou wilt quicken me: and upon the wrath of mine enemies thou hast extended thy hand, and thy right hand hath saved me. Our Lord will repay for me: o Lord thy mercy is for ever: despise not the works of thy hands.</div>
