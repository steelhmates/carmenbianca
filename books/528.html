			<div class='roleText'>The Psalm of David. Lord who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? Or who shall rest in thy holy hill? He that walketh without spot, and worketh justice. He that speaketh truth in his heart, that hath not done guile in his tongue. Nor hath done evil to his neighbour, and hath not taken reproach against his neighbour. The malignant is brought to nothing in his sight: but them that fear our Lord, he glorifieth. He that sweareth to his neighbour, and deceiveth not, That hath not given his money to usury, and hath not taken gifts upon the innocent, He that doth these things, shall not be moved for ever.</div>
