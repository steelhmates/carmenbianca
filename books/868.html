			<div class='roleText'>The sin of Juda is written with iron pen in nail of Adamant, graven upon the breadth of their heart, and in the horns of their altars. When their children shall remember their altars, and their groves, and their trees with green leaves in the high mountains, sacrificing in the field: I will give thy strength, and all thy treasures into spoil, thine excelses for sin in all thy coasts. And thou shalt be left alone of thine inheritance, which I gave thee: and I will make thee serve thine enemies in a land, which thou knowest not: because thou hast kindled a fire in my fury, it shall burn for ever. Thus saith our Lord: Cursed be the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and his heart departeth from our Lord. For he shall be as little bushes in the desert, and shall not see when good shall come: but he shall dwell in dryness in the desert, in a land of saltness, and not habitable. Blessed be the man, that trusteth in our Lord, and our Lord shall be his confidence. And he shall be as a tree that is planted upon the waters, that spreadeth his roots towards moisture: and it shall not fear when the heat cometh. And the leaf thereof shall be green, and in the time of drought it shall not be careful, neither shall it cease at any time to bring forth fruit. The heart of man is perverse, and unsearchable, who shall know it? I^ the Lord that search the heart, and prove the reins: which give to every one according to his way, and according to the fruit of his inventions. The partridge hath nourished that which she brought not forth: he hath gathered riches, and not in judgement: in the midst of his days he shall leave them, and in his latter end he shall be a fool. A throne of glory of height from the beginning, the place of our sanctification: O Lord the expectation of Israel: all that forsake thee, shall be confounded: they that depart from thee, shall be written in the earth: because they have forsaken the vein of living waters our Lord. Heal me o Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be saved: because thou art my praise. Behold they say to me: Where is the word of our Lord? Let it come. And I am not troubled, following thee the Pastor, &amp; the day of man I have not desired, thou knowest. That which hath proceeded out of my lips, hath been right in thy sight. Be not thou a terror unto me, thou art mine hope in the day of affliction. Let them be confounded that persecute me, and let not me be confounded: let them be afraid, and let not me be afraid: bring upon them the day of affliction, and with double destruction destroy them. Thus saith our Lord to me: Go, and stand in the gate of the children of the people, by which the kings of Juda come in, and go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem: and thou shalt say to them: Hear the word of our Lord ye kings of Juda, and all Juda, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter in by these gates. Thus saith our Lord: Take heed to your souls, and carry not burdens on the Sabbath day: neither bring them in by the gates of Jerusalem. And cast not forth burdens out of your houses on the Sabbath day, and all work you shall not do: sanctify the Sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. And they heard not, nor inclined their ear: but hardened their neck, that they would not hear me, and that they would not take discipline. And it shall be: if you will hear me, saith our Lord, that you bring not burdens in by the gates of this city on the Sabbath day: and if you will sanctify the Sabbath day, that you do not all works therein: there shall enter in by the gates of this city kings and Princes, sitting upon the throne of David, and mounting on chariots and horses, they and their Princes, the men of Juda, and the inhabiters of Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever. And they shall come from the cities of Juda, and from round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the champion countries, and from the mountains, and from the South, carrying holocaust, &amp; victim, and sacrifice, &amp; frankincense, &amp; they shall bring in oblation into the house of our Lord. But if you will not hear me, to sanctify the Sabbath day, and not to carry burden, and not to bring in by the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: I will kindle a fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the houses of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched.</div>
