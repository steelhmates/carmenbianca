			<div class='roleText'>And now the seventh month was come, and the children of Israel were in their cities: the people therefore was gathered together as it were one man into Jerusalem. And Josue the son of Josedec rose up, and his brethren the Priests, and Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and his brethren, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, that they might offer on it holocausts, as it is written in the law of Moyses the man of God. And they placed the altar of God upon his feet, the people of the lands round about putting them in fear, and they offered upon it holocaust to our Lord morning and evening. And they made the solemnity of tabernacles, as it is written, and holocaust every day by order according to the precept, the work of the day in his day. And after these things the continual holocaust, as well in the Calends, as in all the solemnities of our Lord, that were consecrated, and in all wherein there was offered voluntarily a gift to our Lord. From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer holocaust to our Lord: moreover the temple of God was not yet founded. And they gave money to hewers of stones and to masons: meat also and drink, and oil to the Sidonians &amp; Tyrians, that they should bring cedar trees from Libanus to the sea unto Joppe, according to that which Cyrus the king of the Persians had commanded them. And in the second year of their coming to the temple of God in Jerusalem, the second month, began Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue the son of Josedec, and the rest of their brethren the Priests, and the Levites, and all that were come from the captivity into Jerusalem, &amp; they appointed Levites from twenty years and upward, that they should hasten forward the work of our Lord. And Josue stood and his sons, and his brethren, Cedmihel, and his sons, and the children of Juda, as it were one man, that they might be instant upon them, that did the work in the temple of God: the sons of Henadad, and their sons, &amp; their brethren Levites. The temple therefore of our Lord being founded by the masons, the priests stood in their attire with trumpets: and the Levites the children of Asaph in cymbals, to praise God by the hands of David the king of Israel. And they sang together in hymns, and confession to our Lord: Because he is good, because his mercy is for ever upon Israel. All the people also made a shout with a loud cry in praising our Lord, because the temple of our Lord was founded. Very many also of the Priests and the Levites, and the Princes of the fathers, and the ancients, that had seen the former temple, when they saw this temple founded, they wept with a loud voice: and many shouting in joy, lifted up their voice. Neither could any man discern the voice of the cry of them that rejoiced, and the voice of the weeping of the people: for one with another the people shouted with a loud cry, and the voice was heard far off.</div>
