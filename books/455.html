			<div class='roleText'>And when all the army heard that Holofernes was beheaded, courage and counsel fell from them, and being shaken with trembling only and fear, they help themselves by flight, so that none spake with his neighbour, but hanging the head, all things left behind, they made haste to escape the Hebrews, whom they heard to come armed upon them, flying by the ways of the fields, and the paths of the hills. The children of Israel therefore seeing them flying, followed them. And they went down sounding with trumpets, and shouting after them. And because the Assyrians were not united together, they went headlong into flight: but the children of Israel pursuing in one company, discomfited all that they could find. Ozias therefore sent messengers through all the cities and countries of Israel. Every country therefore, and every city sent chosen youth armed after them, and they pursued them in the edge of the sword, until they came to the extremity of their borders.

			<div class='roleText'>So be it, so be it. And for thirty days, scarce were the spoils of the Assyrians gathered of the people of Israel. Moreover all things, that were proved to be the peculiar goods of Holofernes, they gave to Judith, in gold, and silver, and garments, and precious stones, and all stuff, and all the things were delivered her of the people. And all the people rejoiced with women, and virgins, and youngmen, on instruments and harps.</div>
