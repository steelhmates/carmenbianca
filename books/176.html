			<div class='roleText'>An Eunuch that hath his stones broken, or cut off, and his yard cut away, shall not enter into the Church of our Lord. Mamzer, that is to say, one born of a common woman, shall not enter into the Church of our Lord, until the tenth generation. The Ammonite and the Moabite yea after the tenth generation shall not enter into the church of our Lord, for ever: because they would not meet you with bread &amp; water in the way, when you came out of Aegypt: and because they hired against thee Balaam, the son of Beor of Mesopotamia in Syria, to curse thee: &amp; our Lord thy God would not hear Balaam, and he turned his cursing into thy blessing, for that he loved thee. Thou shalt not make peace with them, neither do thou seek their good all the days of thy life for ever. Thou shalt not abhor the Idumeite, because he is thy brother: nor the Aegyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land. They that are born of them, in the third generation shall enter into the church of our Lord. When thou goest forth against thine enemies to battle, thou shalt keep thyself from all evil thing. If there be among you a man, that is polluted in a dream by night, he shall go forth without the camp, and shall not return, before he be washed with water at even: and after sun set he shall return into the camp. Thou shalt have a place without the camp, whither thou mayest go to the necessities of nature, carrying on thy girdle a piked instrument. And when thou sittest down, thou shalt dig round about, &amp; with the earth that is digged up shall cover that which thou art eased of (for our Lord thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee, and to give thine enemies unto thee) and let thy camp be holy, &amp; let no filthiness appear therein, lest he forsake thee. Thou shalt not deliver the servant to his master, that is fled to thee. he shall dwell with thee in the place, that shall please him, and in one of thy cities shall he rest: vex him not. There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel nor whoremonger of the sons of Israel. Thou shalt not offer the hire of a strumpet, nor the price of a dog, in the house of our Lord thy God, whatsoever it be that thou hast vowed: because both is abomination before our Lord thy God. Thou shalt not lend to thy brother money to usury, nor corn, nor any other thing: but to the stranger. And to thy brother thou shalt lend that which he needeth, without usury: that our Lord thy God may bless thee in all thy work in the Land, which thou shalt enter to possess. When thou hast vowed a vow to our Lord thy God, thou shalt not slack to pay it: because our Lord thy God will require it. And if thou delay, it shall be reputed to thee for sin. If thou wilt not promise, thou shalt be without sin. But that which is once gone out of thy lips, thou shalt observe, &amp; shalt do as thou hast promised to our Lord thy God, &amp; hast spoken with thy proper will and thine own mouth. Entering into thy neighbour's vineyard, eat grapes as much as shall please thee: but carry none out with thee. If thou enter into thy friend's corn, thou shalt break the ears, and rub them in thy hand: but with a sickle thou shalt not reap.</div>
