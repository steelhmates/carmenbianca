			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, a Psalm of David. Hear o God my prayer when I make petition: from the fear of my enemy deliver my soul. Thou hast protected me from the assembly of the malignant: from the multitude of them that work iniquity. Because they have sharpened their tongues as a sword: they have bent the bow a bitter thing, that they may shoot in secrets at the immaculate. Suddenly they will shoot at him, and will not fear: they have confirmed to themselves a wicked word. They have talked to hide snares: they have said, Who shall see them? They have searched iniquities: they have failed searching with scrutiny. Man shall come to a deep heart: and God shall be exalted. Children's arrows are made their wounds: and their tongues are weakened against them. All that saw them were troubled: and every man feared. And they shewed forth the works of God: and they understood his doings. The just shall rejoice in our Lord, and shall hope in him, &amp; all the right of heart shall be praised.</div>
