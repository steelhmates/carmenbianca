			<div class='roleText'>For behold the dominatour the Lord of hosts shall take away from Jerusalem, and from Juda the valiant &amp; the strong, all strength of bread, and all strength of water. The strong, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and soothsayer, and the ancient. The prince over fifty, and the honourable of countenance, and the counseller, and the wise of workmasters, and the skillful of mystical speech. And I will give children to be their princes, and the effeminate shall rule over them. And the people shall rush violently, man against man, and every one against his neighbour: the child shall make tumult against the ancient, and the base against the noble. For a man shall take hold of his brother, one of the house of his father: Thou hast a garment, be thou our prince, and let this ruin be under thy hand. He shall answer in that day, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I am no physician, &amp; in my house there is no bread, nor garment: do not appoint me prince of the people. For Jerusalem is gone to ruin, and Juda is fallen: because their tongue &amp; their inventions were against our Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty. The knowledge of their face hath answered them: and they have proclaimed their sin as Sodom, neither have they hid it: woe to their soul, because evils are rendered to them. Say to the just that it is well, because he shall eat the fruit of his inventions. Woe to the impious unto evil: for the reward of his hands shall be made to him. My people their exactors have spoiled, &amp; women have ruled over them. My people, they that call thee blessed, the same deceive thee, &amp; dissipate the way of thy steps. Our Lord standeth to judge, &amp; he standeth to judge peoples. Our Lord shall come to judgement with the ancients of his people, and his princes: for you have devoured the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your house. Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the poor, saith our Lord the God of hosts? And our Lord said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>for that the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with stretched out neck, and went with twinglings of eyes, and clapped their hands, walked on their feet, and jetted in a set pace. Our Lord shall make bald the crown of the daughters of Sion, and our Lord shall discover their hair. In that day shall our Lord take away the ornament of shoes, and little moons. And chains, and ouches, and bracelets, and bonnets. And the shedding combs, and slops, and tablets, and sweet balls, and earlets. And rings, and pearls hanging on the forehead. And changes of apparel, and short cloaks, and the fine linen, and needles, and looking glasses, and lawns, and headbands, and bongraces. And for sweet savour there shall be stink, and for a girdle a cord, and for frizzled hair baldness, and for stomacher haircloth. Thy fairest men also shall fall by the sword, and thy strong ones in battle. And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit desolate on the ground.</div>
