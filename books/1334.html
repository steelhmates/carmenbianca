In the midst of the street thereof, &amp; on both sides of the river, the tree of life, yielding twelve fruits, rendering his fruit every month, &amp; the leaves of the tree for the curing of the Gentiles. And no curse shall be any more: &amp; the seat of God &amp; of the Lamb shall be in it, &amp; his servants shall serve him. And they shall see his face: and his name in their foreheads. And night shall be no more: and they shall not need the light of lamp, nor the light of the sun, because our Lord God doth illuminate them, and they shall reign for ever and ever. And he said to me: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Behold I come quickly. And my reward is with me, to render to every man according to his works. I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end. Blessed are they that wash their stoles: that their power may be in the tree of life, and they may enter by the gates into the city. Without are dogs and sorcerers, and the unchaste, and murderers, and servers of idols, &amp; every one that loveth and maketh a lie. I^ JESUS have sent mine Angel, to testify to you these things in the Churches. I am the root and stock of David, the bright and morning star. And the Spirit &amp; the bride say, Come. And he that heareth, let him say, Come. And he that thirsteth, let him come: and he that will, let him take the water of life gratis. For I testify to every one hearing the words of the prophecy of this book, If any man shall add to these things, God shall add upon him the plagues written in this book. And if any man shall diminish of the words of the book of this prophecy: God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and of these things that be written in this book, saith he that giveth testimony of these things. Yea I come quickly: Amen. </div>
