			<div class='roleText'>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: A woman if receiving seed she bear a man child, shall be unclean seven days, according to the days of the separation of her flowers. And the eighth day the little infant shall be circumcised: but herself shall remain three &amp; thirty days in the blood of her purification: No holy thing shall she touch, neither shall she enter into the Sanctuary, until the days of her purification be expired. But if she bear a woman child, she shall be unclean two weeks, according to the custom of the flux of her flowers, and sixty six days she shall remain in the blood of her purification. And when the days of her purification are expired, for a son, or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of a year old for an holocaust, and a young pigeon or a turtle for sin, to the door of the tabernacle of testimony, and shall deliver them to the Priest, who shall offer them before our Lord, and shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed from the flux of her blood, this is the law for her that beareth a man child or a woman child. And if her hand find not, neither is able to offer a lamb, she shall take two turtles, or two young pigeons, one for an holocaust, &amp; another for sin, and the Priest shall pray for her, and so she shall be cleansed.</div>
