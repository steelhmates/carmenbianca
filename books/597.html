			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for wine presses, to the children of Core, a Psalm. How beloved are thy tabernacles, o Lord of hosts! my soul coveteth and fainteth unto the courts of our Lord. My heart and my flesh have rejoiced toward the living God. For the sparrow also hath found her an house: and the turtle-dove a nest for herself, where she may lay her young ones. Thine altars, o Lord of hosts: my King, and my God. Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, o Lord: for ever and ever they shall praise thee. Blessed is the man, whose help is from thee: he hath disposed ascensions in his heart, in the vale of tears, in the place which he hath appointed. For the law-giver shall give blessing, they shall go from virtue into virtue: the God of gods shall be seen in Sion. Lord God of hosts hear my prayer: receive with thine ear, o God of Jacob. Behold, o God our protector: and look upon the face of thy Christ. Because better is one day in thy courts, above thousands. I have chosen to be an abject in the house of my God: rather than to dwell in the tabernacles of sinners. Because God loveth mercy and truth: our Lord will give grace and glory. He will not deprive them of good things, that walk in innocency: o Lord of hosts, blessed is the man that hopeth in thee.</div>
