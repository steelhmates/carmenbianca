			<div class='roleText'>In the seventh year of Jehu reigned Joas: and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. The name of his mother was Sebia of Bersabee. And Joas did right before our Lord all the days, that Joiada the Priest taught him. But yet the excelses he took not away: for the people immolated and burnt incense in the excelses. And Joas said to the Priests: All the money of the sanctified things, which is brought into the temple of our Lord by the passengers, which is offered for the price of a soul, and which of their own accord, and of their own free heart they bring into the temple of our Lord: Let the Priests take it according to their order, and maintain reparations of the house, if they shall see any thing that needeth reparation. Therefore until the three and twentieth year of king Joas, the Priests did not make reparations of the temple. And king Joas called Joiada the high Priest and the Priests, saying to them: Why make you not the reparations of the temple? Take you therefore money no more according to your order, but render it to the reparation of the temple. And the Priests were prohibited to take money any more of the people, and to make the reparations of the temple. And Joiada, the high Priest took a treasury, and opened a hole in the top, &amp; set it by the altar at the right hand of them that go into the house of our Lord, and the Priests that kept the doors did cast into it all the money, that was brought to the temple of our Lord. And when they saw that there was very much money in the treasury, the king's scribe, and the high priest went up, and poured it out, and counted the money, that was found in the house of our Lord: and they gave it according to number and measure into their hand, which did oversee the masons of the house of our Lord: who bestowed it on carpenters, and on masons, such as wrought in the house of our Lord, and made reparations: and on them that hewed stones, and that they should buy trees, and stones, that were hewed, so that the reparation of the house of our Lord was accomplished in all things, which had need of cost to uphold the house. But yet there were not made of the same money the water pots of the temple of our Lord, and the fleshhooks, and censers, and trumpets, and every vessel of gold and silver, of the money that was brought into the temple of our Lord. For it was given them that did the work, that the temple of our Lord might be repaired: and there was no account made with those men that received the money to distribute it to the crafts men, but upon their fidelity they bestowed it. But the money for offence, &amp; the money for sins, they brought not into the temple of our Lord, because it was the Priests'. Then Hazael the king of Syria went up, &amp; fought against Geth, and took it: and directed his face to go up to Jerusalem. For which cause Joas the king of Juda took all the sanctified things, which Josaphat, and Joram, and Ochozias his fathers the kings of Juda had consecrated, and which himself had offered: and all the silver, that could be found in the treasures of the temple of our Lord, and in the king's palace: and sent it to Hazael the king of Syria, and he retired from Jerusalem. But the rest of the words of Joas, and all that he did, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And his servants arose, &amp; conspired among themselves, and struck Joas in the house of Mello in the descent of Sella. For Josachar the son of Semaath, and Jozabad the son of Somer his servants, struck him, and he died: and they buried him with his fathers in the city of David, and Amasias his son reigned for him.</div>
