			<div class='roleText'>Come together, that I may shew you the things that shall come to you in the last days. Come together, and hear you sons of Jacob, hear ye Israel your father. Ruben my first-begotten, thou art my strength, &amp; the beginning of my sorrow: former in gifts, greater in Empire. Thou art poured out as water, increase thou not: because thou didst ascend thy father's bed, and didst defile his couch. Simeon and Levi brethren: vessels of iniquity warring. Into their counsel come not my soul, and in their congregation be not my glory: because in their fury they slew a man, and in their willfulness they undermined a wall. Cursed be their fury, because it is stubborn; and their indignation, because it is hard: I will divide them in Jacob, and will disperse them in Israel. Judas, thee thy brethren shall praise: thy hand shall be in the neck of thine enemies: thy father's children shall adore thee. A lion's whelp Judas: to the prey my son thou didst ascend: taking thy rest thou didst lie as a lion, and as it were a lioness, who shall raise him up? THE SCEPTRE SHALL NOT BE TAKEN AWAY FROM JUDAS, AND A DUKE OUT OF HIS THIGH, TILL HE DO COME THAT IS TO BE SENT, AND THE SAME SHALL BE THE EXPECTATION OF THE GENTILES. Tying to the vineyard his colt, and to the vine, o my son, his she ass. He shall wash his stole in wine, and in the blood of the grape his cloak. His eyes are more beautiful than wine, and his teeth whiter than milk. Zabulon shall dwell in the shore of the sea, and in the road of ships reaching as far as Sidon. Issachar a strong ass lying at rest between the borders. He saw rest that it was good; and the earth that it was very good: and he put under his shoulder to carry, and became serving under tributes. Dan shall judge his own people, as also another tribe in Israel. Be Dan a snake in the way, a serpent in the path, biting the hoofs of the horse, that his rider may fall backward. I will expect THY SALVATION o Lord. Gad, the girded shall fight before him: and himself shall be girded backward. Aser, his bread is fat, and he shall give dainties to kings. Nephthali, a hart let forth, and giving speeches of beauty. Joseph a child increasing, increasing and comely to behold: the daughters coursed to and fro upon the wall. But the dart men did exasperate him, and brawled, and envied him. His bow sat upon the strong, and the bands of his arms and his hands were dissolved, by the hands of the Mighty of Jacob: thence came forth a pastor, the son of Israel. The God of thy father shall be thy helper, and the Almighty shall bless thee with the blessings of heaven from above, with the blessings of the depth that lieth beneath, with the blessings of the paps and of the womb. The blessings of thy father were strengthened with the blessings of his fathers: until the desire of the eternal hills came: be they upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the Nazarite among his brethren. Benjamin a ravening wolf, in the morning shall eat the prey, and in the evening shall divide the spoil. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I am gathered unto my people: bury you me with my fathers in the double cave, which is in the field of Ephron the Hethite, Against Mambre in the Land of Chanaan, which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hethite for a possession to bury in. There they buried him, and Sara his wife: there was Isaac buried with Rebecca his wife: there also Lia doth lie buried. </div>
