			<div class='roleText'>AND it came to pass, when JESUS had ended all these words, he said to his Disciples: You know that after two days shall be Pasch, and the Son of man shall be delivered to be crucified. Then were gathered together the chief Priests and Ancients of the people into the court of the high Priest, who was called Caiphas: and they consulted how they might by some wile apprehend JESUS, and kill him. But they said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Not on the festival day, lest perhaps there might be a tumult among the people. And when JESUS was in Bethania in the house of Simon the Leper there came to him a woman having an alabaster-box of precious ointment, and poured it out upon his head as he sat at the table. And the Disciples seeing it, had indignation saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Whereto is this waste? For this might have been sold for much, and given to the poor. And JESUS knowing it, said to them: Why do you molest this woman? For she hath wrought a good work upon me. For the poor you have always with you: but me you have not always. For she in pouring this ointment upon my body hath done it to bury me. Amen I say to you, wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be reported for a memory of her. Then went one of the Twelve, which was called Judas Iscarioth, to the chief Priests, &amp; said to them: What will you give me, and I will deliver him unto you? But they appointed unto him thirty pieces of silver. And from thenceforth he sought opportunity to betray him. And the first day of the Azymes the Disciples came to JESUS saying: </div>

And Judas that betrayed him, answering said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Drink ye all of this. FOR THIS IS MY BLOOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, WHICH SHALL BE SHED FOR MANY UNTO REMISSION OF SINS. And I say to you, I will not drink from henceforth of this fruit of the vine, until that day when I shall drink it with you new in the Kingdom of my Father. And an hymn being said, they went forth unto Mount-olivet. Then JESUS saith to them: All you shall be scandalized in me in this night. For it is written: I will strike the Pastor, and the sheep of the flock shall be dispersed. But after I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. And Peter answering, said to him: Although all shall be scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized. JESUS said to him: Amen I say to thee, that in this night before the cock crow, thou shalt deny me thrice. Peter saith to him: Yea though I should die with thee, I will not deny thee. Likewise also said all the Disciples. Then JESUS cometh with them into a village called Gethsemani: and he said to his Disciples: Sit you here till I go yonder, and pray. And taking to him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to wax sorrowful and to be sad. Then he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death: stay here, and watch with me. And being gone forward a little, he fell upon his face, praying, and saying: </div>

And he cometh to his Disciples, and findeth them sleeping, and he saith to Peter: Even so? Could you not watch one hour with me? Watch ye, &amp; pray that ye enter not into tentation. The Spirit indeed is prompt, but the flesh weak. Again the second time he went, and prayed, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>My Father, if this chalice may not pass, but I must drink it, thy will be done. And he cometh again, and findeth them sleeping, for their eyes were become heavy. And leaving them, he went again: and he prayed the third time, saying the selfsame word. Then he cometh to his Disciples, and saith to them: Sleep ye now and take rest. Behold the hour approacheth, and the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise, let us go: behold he approacheth that shall betray me. As he yet spake, behold Judas one of the Twelve came, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, sent from the chief Priests and the ancients of the people. And he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hail Rabbi. And he kissed him. And JESUS said to him: Friend, whereto art thou come? Then they drew near, and laid hands on JESUS, and held him. And behold one of them that were with JESUS, stretching forth his hand, drew out his sword; and striking the servant of the high Priest, cut off his ear. Then JESUS saith to him: Return thy sword into his place: for all that take the sword shall perish with the sword. Thinkest thou that I cannot ask my Father, and he will give me presently more than twelve legions of Angels? How then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that so it must be done? In that hour JESUS said to the multitudes: You are come out as it were to a thief^ with swords and clubs to apprehend me. I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and you laid no hands on me. And all this was done, that the scriptures of the Prophets might be fulfilled. Then the Disciples all leaving him, fled. But they taking hold of JESUS, led him to Caiphas the high Priest, where the Scribes and ancients were assembled. And Peter followed him a far off, even to the court of the high Priest. And going in he sat with the servants, that he might see the end. And the chief Priests and the whole Council sought false witness against JESUS, that they might put him to death: and they found not, whereas many false witnesses had come in. And last of all there came two false witnesses; and they said: </div>

And the high Priest rising up, said to him: Answerest thou nothing to the things which these do testify against thee? But JESUS held his peace. And the high Priest said to him: I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us if thou be Christ the Son of God. JESUS saith to him: Thou hast said. Nevertheless I say to you, hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of Heaven. Then the high Priest rent his garments, saying: </div>

Then he began to curse and to swear that he knew not the man. And incontinent the cock crew. And Peter remembered the word of JESUS which he had said: </div>
