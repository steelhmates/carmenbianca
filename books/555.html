			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, understanding to the sons of Core. Even as the hart desireth after the fountains of waters: so doth my soul desire after thee, o God. My soul hath thirsted after God the strong living: when shall I come and appear before the face of God? My tears have been breads unto me day and night: whilst it is said to me daily: Where is thy God? These things have I remembered, and have poured out my soul in me, because I shall pass into the place of a marvelous tabernacle, even to the house of God. In the voice of exultation, and confession: the sound of one feasting. Why art thou sorrowful my soul? &amp; why dost thou trouble me? Hope in God, because yet I will confess to him: the salvation of my countenance, and my God. My soul is troubled toward myself; therefore will I be mindful of thee from the land of Jordan, and Hermoniim from the little mountain. Depth calleth on depth, in the voice of thy flood-gates. All thy high things, and thy ways have passed over me. In the day our Lord hath commanded his mercy: and in the night a song of him. With me is prayer to the God of my life: I will say to God: Thou art my defender. Why hast thou forgotten me? And why go I sorrowful, whilst mine enemy afflicteth me? Whilst my bones are broken, mine enemies that trouble me have upbraided me: Whilst they say to me day by day: Where is thy God? Why art thou heavy, o my soul? &amp; why dost thou trouble me? Hope in God, because yet I will confess to him: the salvation of my countenance, and my God.</div>
