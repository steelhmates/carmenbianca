			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, a Psalm to David himself. Expecting I expected our Lord, and he hath attended to me. And he heard my prayers, and brought me out of the lake of misery, and from the mire of dregs. And hath set my feet upon a rock: and hath directed my steps. And he hath put a new canticle into my mouth: a song to our God. Many shall see, and shall fear: and they shall hope in our Lord. Blessed is the man, whose hope is in the name of our Lord: and hath not had regard to vanities and false madness. Thou hast done many thy marvelous things, o Lord my God: &amp; in thy cogitations there is none that may be like to thee. I have declared and have spoken: they multiplied above number. Sacrifice and oblation thou wouldest not: but ears thou hast perfited to me. Holocaust and for sin thou didst not require: then said I, Behold I come. In the head of the book it is written of me, that I should do thy will: my God I would, and thy law in the midst of my heart. I have declared thy justice in the great Church, lo I will not stay my lips: Lord thou hast known it. Thy justice I have not hid in my heart: thy truth and thy salvation I have spoken. I have not hid thy mercy, and thy truth from the great Council. But thou, o Lord, make not thy commiserations far from me: thy mercy, and thy truth have always received me. Because evils have compassed me, which have no number: mine iniquities have overtaken me, &amp; I was not able to see. They are multiplied above the hairs of my head: and my heart hath forsaken me. It may please thee, o Lord, to deliver me: Lord have respect to help me. Let them be confounded and ashamed together, that seek my soul to take it away. Let them be turned backward, and be ashamed that will me evils. Let them forthwith receive their confusion, that say to me: Well, well. Let all that seek thee rejoice and be glad upon thee: and let them that love thy salvation, say always: Our Lord be magnified: But I am a beggar, and poor: Our Lord is careful to me. Thou art my helper, &amp; my protector: my God be not slack.</div>
