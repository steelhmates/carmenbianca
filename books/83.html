			<div class='roleText'>Go, get thee up from this place, thou and thy people which thou hast brought out of the Land of Aegypt, into the land whereof I sware to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying: To thy seed I will give it: and I will send an Angel thy precursor, that I may cast out the Chananeite, and Amorrheite, and Hetheite, and Pherezeite, and Heveite, and Jebuseite, and thou mayest enter into the land that floweth with milk and honey: for I will not go up with thee, because thou art a stiff-necked people: lest perhaps I destroy thee in the way. </div>

Moyses also taking the tabernacle, pitched it without the camp a far off, and called the name thereof, The Tabernacle of covenant. And all the people, that had any question, went forth to the Tabernacle of covenant, without the camp. And when Moyses went forth to the tabernacle, all the people rose up, and every one stood in the door of his pavilion, and they beheld the back of Moyses, till he entered into the tabernacle. And when he was entered into the Tabernacle of covenant, the pillar of the cloud came down, and stood at the door, &amp; he spake with Moyses, all they beholding that the pillar of the cloud stood at the door of the Tabernacle. And they stood, &amp; adored at the doors of their tabernacles. And our Lord spake unto Moyses face to face, as a man is wont to speak to his friend. And when he returned into the camp, his minister Josue the son of Nun, a young man, departed not from the Tabernacle. And Moyses said to our Lord: </div>
