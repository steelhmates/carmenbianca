			<div class='roleText'>He stirreth the people teaching throughout all Jewry, beginning from Galilee even hither. But Pilate hearing Galilee, asked if the man were of Galilee. And when he understood that he was of Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him back to Herod, who was also himself at Jerusalem in those days. And Herod seeing JESUS, was very glad, for he was desirous of a long time to see him, for because he heard many things of him: and he hoped to see some sign wrought by him. And he asked him in many words. But he answered him nothing. And there stood the chief Priests and the Scribes constantly accusing him. And Herod with his army set him at naught: and he mocked him, putting on him a white garment, and sent him back to Pilate. And Herod and Pilate were made friends that day. For before^ they were enemies one to another. And Pilate calling together the chief Priests and Magistrates, and the people, said to them: You have presented unto me this man, as averting the people, and behold I examining him before you, have found no cause in this man of those things, wherein you accuse him. No, nor Herod neither. For I sent you to him, and behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him. I will chasten him therefore and dismiss him. And he of necessity had to release unto them upon the feast day, one. But the whole multitude together cried out, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Crucify, crucify him. And he the third time said to them: Why, what evil hath this man done? I find no cause of death in him. I will correct him therefore &amp; let him go. But they were instant with loud voices requiring that he might be crucified. And their voices prevailed. And Pilate adjudged their petition to be done. And he released unto them him that for murder and sedition had been cast into prison, whom they demanded: but JESUS he delivered to their pleasure. And when they led him, they took one Simon of Cyrene coming from the country: and they laid the Cross upon him to carry after JESUS. And there followed him a great multitude of people, and of women which bewailed and lamented him. But JESUS turning to them, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not upon me, but weep upon yourselves, and upon your children. For behold the days shall come, wherein they will say: Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that have not born, &amp; the paps that have not given suck. Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall upon us: and to the hills, Cover us. For if in the green wood they do these things, in the dry what shall be done? And there were led also other two malefactors with him, to be executed. And after they came to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified him: and the thieves, one on the right hand and the other on the left. And JESUS said: </div>

And he said to JESUS: Lord, remember me when thou shalt come into thy Kingdom. And JESUS said to him: Amen I say to thee; this day thou shalt be with me in Paradise. And it was almost the sixth hour: and there was made darkness upon the whole earth until the ninth hour. And the sun was darkened; and the veil of the temple was rent in the midst. And JESUS crying with a loud voice, said: </div>

And all his acquaintance stood a far off, and the women that had followed him from Galilee, seeing these things. And behold a man named Joseph, which was a Senator, a good man and a just. He had not consented to their counsel and doings, of Arimathaea a city of Jewry, who also himself expected the Kingdom of God. This man came to Pilate, and asked the body of JESUS. And taking it down, wrapped it in sindon, and laid him in a monument hewed of stone, wherein never yet any man had been laid. And it was the day of Parasceve, and the Sabboth drew near. And the women that were come with him from Galilee, following after, saw the monument, and how his body was laid. And returning they prepared spices and ointments: and on the Sabboth they rested according to the commandment.</div>
