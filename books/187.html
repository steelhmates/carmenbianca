			<div class='roleText'>Moyses therefore went up from the champion of Moab upon mount Nebo, into the top of Phasga against Jericho: and our Lord shewed him all the land of Galaad as far as Dan, and all Nephthali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasses, and all the Land of Juda unto the utmost sea, and the south part, and the breadth of the plain of Jericho, a city of palm-trees as far as Segor. And our Lord said to him: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>And Moyses the servant of our Lord died there, in the land of Moab, our Lord commanding it: and he buried him in the valley of the Land of Moab against Phogor: and no man hath known his sepulchre until this present day. Moyses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, neither were his teeth moved. And the children of Israel mourned him in the champion country of Moab thirty days: &amp; the days of their mourning that mourned for Moyses were accomplished. And Josue the son of Nun was replenished with the spirit of wisdom, because Moyses did put his hands upon him. And the children of Israel obeyed him, and did as our Lord commanded Moyses. And there rose no more a Prophet in Israel as Moyses, whom our Lord had known face to face, in all signs and wonders, which he sent by him, to do in the Land of Aegypt to Pharao, and to all his servants, and to his whole Land, and all the strong hand, and great marvels, which Moyses did before all Israel.</div>
