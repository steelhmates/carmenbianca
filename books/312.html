			<div class='roleText'>And after these words, at that time Naboth the Jezrahelite had a vineyard, which was in Jezrahel, beside the palace of Achab the king of Samaria. Achab therefore spake to Naboth, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Give me thy vineyard, that I may make me a garden of herbs, because it is nigh, and joining to my house, and I will give thee for it a better vineyard: or if thou think it more commodious for thee, the price of silver, so much as it is worth. To whom Naboth answered: Our Lord be merciful to me, that I give not the inheritance of my fathers to thee. Achab therefore came into his house with indignation, and fretting upon the word that Naboth the Jezrahelite had spoken to him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will not give thee the inheritance of my fathers. And casting himself upon his bed, he turned away his face to the wall, and did not eat bread. And Jezabel his wife went in unto him, and said to him: What is this matter, whereupon thy soul is grieved? And why eatest thou not bread? Who answered her: I spake to Naboth the Jezrahelite, and said to him: Give me thy vineyard, taking money for it: or if it please thee, I will give thee a better vineyard for it. And he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will not give thee my vineyard. Jezabel therefore his wife said to him: Thou art of great authority, and doest well govern the Kingdom of Israel: Arise, and eat bread, and be of good cheer, I will give thee the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite. She therefore wrote letters in the name of Achab, and signed them with his ring, and sent to the ancients, and the chief men that were in his city, and dwelt with Naboth. And this was the tenor of the letters: Proclaim a fast, and make Naboth sit among the chief of the people, and suborn two men the children of Belial against him, and let them bear false testimony: that he hath blessed God and the king: and bring him forth, and stone him, and so let him die. His citizens therefore the ancients and chief men, that dwelt with him in the city, did as Jezabel had commanded them, and as it was written in the letters which she sent to them: they proclaimed a fast, and made Naboth sit among the chief of the people. And two men the children of the devil being brought forth, they made them sit against him: but they, as devilish men, gave testimony against him before the multitude: Naboth hath blessed God and the king: for the which thing they brought him forth without the city, and killed him with stones. And they sent to Jezabel, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Naboth is stoned, and is dead. And it came to pass, when Jezabel had heard that Naboth was stoned, and dead, she spake to Achab: Arise, and possess the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite, who would not agree unto thee, and give it taking money: for Naboth liveth not, but is dead. Which when Achab had heard, to wit, that Naboth was dead, he arose, and went down into the vineyard of Naboth the Jezrahelite, to possess it. The word of our Lord therefore came to Elias the Thesbite, saying: Arise, and go down to meet Achab the king of Israel, who is in Samaria: behold he goeth down to the vineyard of Naboth, to possess it: and thou shalt speak to him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Thus saith our Lord: Thou hast slain, moreover also thou hast possest. And after these words thou shalt add: Thus saith our Lord: In this place, wherein the dogs have licked the blood of Naboth, they shall lick thy blood also. And Achab said to Elias: Hast thou found me thine enemy? Who said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I have found thee, for that thou art sold, to do evil in the sight of our Lord. Behold I will bring evil upon thee, and will cut down thy posterity, and will kill of Achab him that pisseth against the wall, and the inclosed, and the last in Israel. And I will make thy house, as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and as the house of Baasa the son of Ahias: because thou hast done to provoke me to anger, and hast made Israel to sin. But of Jezabel also our Lord spake, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The dogs shall eat Jezabel in the field of Jezrahel. If Achab die in the city, the dogs shall eat him: but if he die in the field, the fowls of the air shall eat him. Therefore there was not such another as Achab, who was sold to do evil in the sight of our Lord: for his wife Jezabel set him on, and he became abominable, in so much that he followed the idols, which the Amorrheites had made, whom our Lord consumed before the face of the children of Israel. Therefore when Achab had heard these words, he rent his garments, and covered his flesh with haircloth, and fasted, and slept in sackcloth, and walked casting down his head. And the word of our lord came to Elias the Thesbite, saying: Hast thou not seen Achab humbled before me? Therefore, because he hath humbled himself for my sake, I will not bring in the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</div>
