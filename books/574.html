			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, in hymns to David. Hear, o God, my petition: attend to my prayer. From the ends of the earth I have cried to thee: whilst my heart was in anguish, thou didst exalt me on a rock. Thou hast conducted me, because thou art made my hope: a tower of strength from the face of the enemy. I shall inhabit in thy tabernacle for ever: I shall be protected in the covert of thy wings. Because thou my God hast heard my prayer: thou hast given inheritance to those that fear thy name. Thou wilt add days upon the days of the king: his years even unto the day of generation and generation. He is permanent for ever in the sight of God: his mercy and truth who shall require? So will I say a Psalm to thy name for ever and ever: that I may render my vows from day to day.</div>
