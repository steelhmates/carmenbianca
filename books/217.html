			<div class='roleText'>And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of our Lord: who delivered them into the hand of Madian seven years, and they were sore oppressed of them. And they made themselves dens and caves in the mountains, and very well fenced places to resist. And when Israel had sown, Madian came up and Amalec, and the rest of the East nations: and pitching their tents by them wasted all things as they were in the blade unto the entering of Gaza: &amp; they left nothing at all in Israel that pertained to man's life, not sheep, not oxen, not asses. For they and all their flocks came with their tabernacles, and like unto locusts filled all places, an innumerable multitude of men, &amp; of camels, wasting whatsoever they touched. And Israel was sore humbled in the sight of Madian. And he cried to our Lord desiring help against the Madianites. Who sent unto them a man that was a Prophet, and he spake: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: I made you to come up out of Aegypt, and brought you out of the house of servitude, &amp; delivered you out of the hands of the Aegyptians, and of all the enemies, that afflicted you: and I cast them out at your entering, and delivered you their Land. And I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I^ the Lord your God, fear not the gods of the Ammorrheites, in whose land you dwell. And you would not hear my voice. And an Angel of our Lord came, and sat under an oak, that was in Ephra, and pertained to Joas the father of the family of Ezri. And when Gedeon his son did thresh and purge wheat in a winepress, to fly Madian, the Angel of our Lord appeared to him, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I beseech thee, my Lord, wherein shall I deliver Israel? Behold my family is the meanest in Manasses, &amp; I^ the least in my father's house. And our Lord said to him: I will be with thee: and thou shalt strike Madian as it were one man. And he said: </div>

Neither depart thou hence, till I return to thee, bringing a sacrifice, and offering to thee. Who answered: I will tarry thy coming. Gedeon therefore went in, and boiled a kid, and of a bushel of flour baked unleavened loaves: and putting the flesh in a basket, and the broth of the flesh into a pot, he carried all under the oak, and offered to him. To whom the Angel of our Lord said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Take the flesh and the unleavened loaves, and put them upon that rock, and pour out the broth thereon. And when he had done, the Angel of our Lord stretched forth the tip of the rod, which he held in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened loaves: and there arose a fire from the rock, and consumed the flesh, and the unleavened loaves: and the Angel of our Lord vanished from his eyes. And Gedeon seeing that it was the Angel of our Lord, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Alas my Lord God: that I have seen the Angel of our Lord face to face. And our Lord said to him: Peace be with thee: fear not, thou shalt not die. And Gedeon built there an altar to our Lord, &amp; called it, our Lord's peace, until this present day. And when he was yet in Ephra, which is of the family of Ezri, that night our Lord said to him: Take a bullock of thy father's, and another bullock of seven years, and thou shalt destroy the altar of Baal, which is thy father's: and cut down the grove, that is about the altar: and thou shalt build an altar to the Lord thy God in the top of this rock, whereupon thou didst lay the sacrifice before: and thou shalt take the second bullock, and shalt offer an holocaust upon a pile of the wood, which thou shalt cut down out of the grove. Gedeon therefore taking to him ten men of his servants, did as our Lord had commanded him. But fearing his father's house, and the men of that city, he would not do it by day, but accomplished all things by night. And when the men of that town were risen in the morning, they saw the altar of Baal destroyed, and the grove cut down, and the other bullock laid upon the altar, which then was built. They said one to another: Who hath done this? And when they inquired for the author of the fact, it was said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Gedeon the son of Joas did all these things. And they said to Joas: Bring forth thy son hither, that he may die: because he hath destroyed the altar of Baal, and hath cut down his grove. To whom he answered: Why are you revengers of Baal, that you fight for him? He that is his adversary, let him die before tomorrow light appear: if he be God, revenge he himself, on him that hath razed his altar. From that day Gedeon was called Jerobaal, because Joas had said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let Baal revenge himself on him, that hath razed his altar. Therefore all Madian, and Amalec, and the east peoples were gathered together, and passing over Jordan, camped in the vale Jezrael. But the spirit of our Lord revested Gedeon, who sounding with a trumpet called together the house of Abiezer, to follow him. And he sent messengers into all Manasses, which it-self also did follow him: and other messengers into Aser and Zabulon and Nephthali, which met him. And Gedeon said to God: If thou save Israel by my hand, as thou hast spoken, I will put this fleece of wool on the floor: if there shall be dew in the fleece only, and on all the ground dryness, I shall know that by my hand, as thou hast spoken, thou wilt deliver Israel. And it came so to pass. And rising in the night wringing the fleece, he filled a vessel with the dew. And he said again to God: Let not thy fury be angry against me if I tempt once again, seeking a sign in the fleece. I desire that the fleece only may be dry, and all the ground wet with dew. And God did that night as he had requested: and there was dryness in the fleece only, and dew on all the ground.</div>
