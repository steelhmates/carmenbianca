			<div class='roleText'>Ephraim feedeth the wind, and followeth the heat: all the day he multiplieth lying and waste: and he hath made a league with the Assyrians, and he carried oil into Aegypt. The judgement therefore of our Lord with Juda, and visitation upon Jacob: according to his ways, &amp; according to his inventions he will render to him.

And he prevailed against the Angel, and was strengthened: and he wept, and besought him: in Bethel he found him, and there he spake with us. And our Lord the God of hosts, the Lord is his memorial.

If an idol in Galaad, then in vain were they in Galgal immolating with oxen: for their altars also as heaps upon the furrows of the field. Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept her. But by a Prophet our Lord brought Israel out of Aegypt: and by a Prophet he was preserved. Ephraim hath provoked me to wrath in his bitterness, and his blood shall come upon him, and his reproach his Lord will restore to him.</div>
