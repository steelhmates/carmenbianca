			<div class='roleText'>Ephraim feedeth the wind, and followeth the heat: all the day he multiplieth lying and waste: and he hath made a league with the Assyrians, and he carried oil into Aegypt. The judgement therefore of our Lord with Juda, and visitation upon Jacob: according to his ways, &amp; according to his inventions he will render to him. In the womb he supplanted his brother: and in his strength he was directed with the Angel. And he prevailed against the Angel, and was strengthened: and he wept, and besought him: in Bethel he found him, and there he spake with us. And our Lord the God of hosts, the Lord is his memorial.

And I^ the Lord thy God out of the Land of Aegypt I will yet make thee sit in tabernacles, as in the days of festivity. And I have spoken upon the Prophets, and I have multiplied vision, and in the hand of the Prophets I have been resembled. If an idol in Galaad, then in vain were they in Galgal immolating with oxen: for their altars also as heaps upon the furrows of the field. Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served for a wife, and for a wife he kept her. But by a Prophet our Lord brought Israel out of Aegypt: and by a Prophet he was preserved. Ephraim hath provoked me to wrath in his bitterness, and his blood shall come upon him, and his reproach his Lord will restore to him.</div>
