			<div class='roleText'>Command the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: My oblation and breads, and burnt sacrifice of most sweet odour offer ye in their times. These are the sacrifices which you must offer: Two lambs of a year old without blemish daily for the everlasting holocaust: one you shall offer in the morning, and the other at even: the tenth part of an ephi of flour, which shall be tempered with the purest oil, and shall have the fourth part of an hin. It is the continual holocaust which you offered in Mount Sinai for a most sweet odour of the burnt sacrifice of the Lord. and for a libament you shall offer of wine the fourth part of an hin for every lamb in the Sanctuary of the Lord. And the other lamb in like manner you shall offer at even according to all the rite of the morning sacrifice, and of the libaments thereof, an oblation of most sweet odour to the Lord. And on the day of the Sabbath, you shall offer two lambs of a year old without blemish, and two tenths of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice, &amp; the libaments, which are ritely poured every Sabbath for an everlasting holocaust. And in the Calends you shall offer an holocaust to the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, seven lambs of a year old without blemish, and three tenths of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice for every calf: and two tenths of flour tempered with oil to every ram: and the tenth part of a tenth of flour tempered with oil in sacrifice to every lamb. It is an holocaust of most sweet odour and burnt sacrifice to the Lord. And the libaments of wine, that are to be poured for every victim, shall be these: The half part of an hin for every calf, the third to a ram, the fourth to a lamb. This shall be the holocaust through all months that succeed one another as the year turneth about. A buck goat also shall be offered to the Lord for sins an everlasting holocaust with his libaments. And in the first month, the fourteenth day of the month shall be the Phase of the Lord, and the fifteenth day the solemnity: seven days shall they eat azymes. Of the which the first day shall be venerable &amp; holy: no servile work shall you do therein. And you shall offer burnt sacrifice an holocaust to the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, seven lambs of a year old without blemish: and the sacrifice of every one of flour which shall be tempered with oil, three tenths to every calf, &amp; two tenths to every ram, and the tenth part of a tenth to every lamb, that is to say, to the seven lambs. And one buck goat for sin, that expiation may be made for you, beside the morning holocaust which you shall always offer. So shall you do every day of the seven days for a food of the fire, &amp; for a most sweet odour to the Lord, which shall rise of the holocaust, and of the libaments of every one. The seventh day also shall be most solemn and holy unto you; no servile work shall you do therein. The day also of first fruits when you shall offer new fruits to the Lord, after that the weeks be accomplished, shall be venerable and holy: no servile work shall you do therein. And you shall offer an holocaust for a most sweet odour to the Lord, two calves of the herd, one ram, and seven Lambs of a year old without blemish: and in the sacrifices of them three tenths of flour tempered with oil to every calf, to every ram two, every lamb the tenth part of a tenth, which together are seven lambs. A goat also which is slain for expiation: beside the everlasting holocaust &amp; the libaments thereof. All shall you offer without blemish with their libaments.</div>
