			<div class='roleText'>My son, forget not my law, and let thy heart keep my precepts. For they shall add to thee length of days, and years of life, and peace. Let not mercy and truth leave thee, put them about thy throat and write them in the tables of thy heart: and thou shalt find grace; and good discipline before God and men. Have confidence in our Lord with all thy heart and lean not upon thine own prudence. In all thy ways think on him, and he will direct thy steps. Be not wise in thine own conceit: fear God, and depart from evil: for it shall be health to thy navel, and watering of thy bones. Honour our Lord with thy substance, and give to him of the first of all thy fruits: and thy barns shall be replenished with fullness, and thy presses shall run-over with wine. My son, cast not away the discipline of our Lord: neither do thou faint when thou art chastised of him: for whom our Lord loveth he chastiseth: and as a father in the son he pleaseth himself. Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and floweth with prudence: better is the purchasing thereof than merchandise of silver, and her fruit than chief and the purest gold: she is more precious than all riches: and all things that are desired, are not able to be compared with her. Length of days in her right hand, &amp; in her left hand riches and glory. Her ways are beautiful ways, and all her paths peaceable. She is a tree of life to them that shall apprehend her: and he that shall hold her is blessed. Our Lord by wisdom foundeth the earth, established the heavens by prudence. By his wisdom the depths have broken forth, and the clouds wax thick with dew. My son, let not these things depart from thine eyes: keep the law &amp; counsel: and there shall be life to thy soul, and grace to thy jaws. Then shalt thou walk confidently in thy way, and thy foot shall not stumble: if thou sleep, thou shalt not fear: thou shalt rest, and thy sleep shall be sweet. Dread not at sudden terror, and the power of the impious falling upon thee. For our Lord will be at thy side, and will keep thy foot that thou be not taken. Do not prohibit him to do good, that is able: if thou be able, thyself also do good. Say not to thy friend: go, and return; and tomorrow I will give to thee: whereas thou mayst give forthwith. Practise not evil against thy friend, when he hath affiance in thee. Contend not against man without cause, whereas he hath done thee no evil. Do not envy an unjust man, nor imitate his ways: because every deluder is an abomination of our Lord, and his communication is with the simple. There is poverty from our Lord in the house of the impious: but the habitations of the just shall be blessed. He shall delude the deluders, and to the mild he will give grace. The wise shall possess glory: the exaltation of fools ignominy.</div>
