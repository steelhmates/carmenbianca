			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, the Psalm of David. How long, o Lord wilt thou forget me unto the end? How long doest thou turn away thy face from me? How long shall I put counsels in my soul, sorrow in my heart by day? How long shall mine enemies be exalted over me? Regard and hear me, o Lord my God. Illuminate mine eyes that I sleep not in death at any time: lest sometime mine enemy say: I have prevailed against him. They that trouble me, will rejoice if I be moved: but I have hoped in thy mercy. My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation: I will sing to our Lord, which giveth me good things: and I will sing to the name of our Lord most high.</div>
