			<div class='roleText'>And king David was old, and had many days of age: &amp; when he was covered with cloths, he was not warmed. His servants therefore said to him: Let us seek for our lord the king a young woman a virgin, and let her stand before the king, and cherish him, and sleep in his bosom, and warm our lord the king. They sought therefore a beautiful young woman in all the coasts of Israel, and they found Abisag a Sunamite, &amp; brought her to the king. And the damsel was exceeding beautiful, and she slept with the king, and served him, but the king did not know her. And Adonias the son of Haggith was elevated, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why didst thou this? And he also was very beautiful, the second born after Absalom. And he had talk with Joab the son of Sarvia, and with Abiathar the priest, who furthered Adonias' side. But Sadoc the Priest, and Banaias the son of Joiada, and Nathan the Prophet, and Semei, and Rei, and the strength of David's army was not with Adonias. Adonias therefore having immolated rams and calves, and all fat beasts beside the Stone zoheleth, which was nigh to the Fountain Rogel, called all his brethren the sons of the king, and all the men of Juda the servants of the king: But Nathan the Prophet, and Banaias, and all the strong ones, and Salomon his brother he called not. Nathan therefore said to Bethsabee the mother of Salomon: Hast thou not heard that Adonias the son of Haggith hath reigned, &amp; our lord David is ignorant thereof? Now therefore come, take counsel of me, &amp; save thy life, &amp; thy son Salomon's. Go, &amp; enter in to king David, &amp; say to him: Didst not thou my lord king swear to me thy handmaid, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Salomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit in my throne? Why then reigneth Adonias? And whiles thou art yet speaking there with the king, I will come after thee, &amp; make up thy words. Bethsabee therefore went in to the king in the chamber: and the king was exceeding old, and Abisag the Sunamite ministered to him. Bethsabee bowed herself, and adored the king. To whom the king said: </div>

And behold now Adonias reigneth, thou my lord the king not knowing thereof. He hath killed oxen, and all fat things, and many rams, and called all the king's sons. Abiathar also the Priest, and Joab the General of the warfare: but Salomon thy servant he called not. Notwithstanding my lord king, the eyes of all Israel look upon thee, that thou wouldest shew them, who shall sit in thy throne my lord king after thee. And it shall be when my lord king sleepeth with his fathers, I &amp; my son Salomon shall be sinners. As she was yet speaking with the king, Nathan the Prophet came. And they told the king, saying: </div>
