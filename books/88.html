			<div class='roleText'>He made also the Altar of Holocaust of the wood setim, five cubits four square, and three in height: the horns whereof did proceed from the corners, and he covered it with plates of brass. And for the uses thereof he prepared of brass diverse vessels, cauldrons, tongs, flesh-hooks, pot-hooks, and fire pans. And the grate thereof in manner of a net he made of brass, and under it in the midst of the altar an hearth, casting four rings at as many tops of the net, to put in bars to carry it: the which themselves also he made of the wood setim, and covered them with plates of brass: and he drew them through the rings, that stood out in the sides of the altar. And the altar itself was not massy, but hollow of boards, and within empty. He made also the laver of brass, with the foot thereof, of women's glasses, that watched in the door of the tabernacle. He made also the court, in the south side whereof were hangings of twisted silk, of an hundred cubits, twenty pillars of brass with their feet, the heads of the pillars, and the whole graving of the work, of silver. In like manner at the north side the hangings, pillars, and feet &amp; the heads of the pillars were of the same measure, and work &amp; metal. But on that side that looketh to the west, there were hangings of fifty cubits, ten brazen pillars with their feet, and the heads of the pillars, and all the graving of the work, of silver. Moreover against the east he prepared hangings of fifty cubits: of the which, one side contained fifteen cubits of three pillars, with their feet: &amp; on the other side (because between both he made the entry of the tabernacle) there were hangings equally of fifteen cubits, &amp; three pillars, &amp; feet as many. All the hangings of the court were woven of twisted silk. The feet of the pillars were of brass, &amp; their heads with all their gravings of silver: but the pillars also of the court themselves he plated with silver. And in the entry thereof he made with embroidered work a hanging of hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and twisted silk, that had twenty cubits in length, but the height was five cubits, according to the measure which all the hangings of the court had. And the pillars in the entry were four with feet of brass, and their heads and gravings of silver. The pins also of the tabernacle and of the court round about he made of brass. These are the instruments of the tabernacle of testimony, which were numbered according to the precept of Moyses, in the ceremonies of the Levites by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the Priest: which Beseleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Juda had accomplished, as our Lord commanded by Moyses, having joined to himself for his companion Ooliab the son of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan: who was himself also an egregious artificer in wood, and a tapester, and embroiderer of hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and silk. All the gold that was spent in the work of the Sanctuary, and that was offered in donaries, was nine and twenty talents, and seven hundred thirty sicles according to the measure of the Sanctuary. And it was offered of them that passed to the number, from twenty years and upward, of six hundred three thousand, &amp; five hundred fifty able men to bear arms. There were moreover an hundred talents of silver, whereof were cast the feet of the Sanctuary, and of the entry where the veil hangeth. An hundred feet were made of an hundred talents, one talent being accounted for every foot. And of the thousand seven hundred, and seventy five he made the heads of the pillars, which themselves he also plated with silver. Of brass also there were offered seventy two thousand talents, and four hundred sicles besides, of the which were cast the feet in the entry of the tabernacle of testimony, and the altar of brass with the grate thereof, and all the vessels, that pertain to the use thereof, and the feet of the court as well in the circuit as in the entry thereof, and the pins of the tabernacle and of the court round about.</div>
