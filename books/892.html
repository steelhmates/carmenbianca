			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in the seventh month, came Ismahel the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the king's blood, and the nobles of the king, and ten men with him, to Godolias the son of Ahicam into Masphath: and they did eat bread there together in Masphath. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias arose, &amp; the ten men, that were with him, and they struck Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made ruler over the land. All the Jews also that were with Godolias in Masphath, and the Chaldees that were found there, and the men of war did Ismahel strike. And the second day after he had killed Godolias, no man yet knowing it, there came men from Sichem, and from Silo, and from Samaria eighty men: their beard shaven, and their garments rent, and ill favoured: and they had gifts, and frankincense in their hand, to offer in the house of our Lord. Ismahel therefore the son of Nathanias going forth to meet them out of Masphath, went going &amp; weeping: and when he had met them, he said to them: Come to Godolias the son of Ahicam. Who when they were come to the midst of the city, Ismahel the son of Nathanias slew them about the midst of the lake, he and the men that were with him. But ten men were found among them, that said to Ismahel: Kill us not: because we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and barley, and oil, and honey. And he ceased, and slew not them with their brethren. And the lake into the which Ismahel threw all the carcasses of the men whom he struck for Godolias, is the same that king Asa made for Baasa the king of Israel: the same did Ismahel the son of Nathanias fill with them that were slain. And Ismahel led away captive all the remnant of the people that were in Masphath: the king's daughters, and all the people, that remained in Masphath: whom Nabuzardan the Prince of the war had commended to Godolias the son of Ahicam. And Ismahel the son of Nathanias took them, &amp; he went away, to pass unto the children of Ammon. But Johanan the son of Caree, &amp; all the Princes of the men of war, that were with him, heard all the evil that Ismahel the son of Nathanias had done. And taking all the men, they went forth to make battle against Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and they found him at the many waters, that are in Gabaon. And when all the people that was with Ismahel, had seen Johanan the son of Caree, &amp; all the Princes of the men of war, that were with him, they rejoiced. And all the people, whom Ismael had taken, returned into Masphath: and returning they went to Johanan the son of Caree. But Ismahel the son of Nathanias fled with eight men, from the face of Johanan, and went to the children of Ammon. Johanan therefore the son of Caree, and all the Princes of the men of war, that were with him, took all the remnant of the common people, which they had brought back from Ismahel the son of Nathanias out of Masphath, after that he had struck Godolias the son of Ahicam: strong men for battle, &amp; women, &amp; children, &amp; eunuchs, which he had brought back from Gabaon. And they went, &amp; sat sojourning in Chamaam, which is beside Bethlehem: that they might go forward, &amp; enter into Aegypt from the face of the Chaldees: for they feared them, because Ismahel the son of Nathanias had strucken Godolias the son of Ahicam, whom the king of Babylon had made ruler in the land of Juda.</div>
