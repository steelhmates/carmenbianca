			<div class='roleText'>The prayer of Jesus the son of Sirach. I will confess to thee o Lord King, and will praise thee God my Savior. I will confess to thy name: because thou art become my helper and protector, &amp; hast delivered my body from perdition, from the snare of an unjust tongue, and from the lips of them that work lying, and in the sight of them that stood up^ thou art become my helper. And thou hast delivered me according to the multitude of the mercy of thy name from them that did roar, prepared to devour, out of the hands of them that seek my soul, and from the gates of tribulations which have compassed me: from the oppression of the flame, which hath compassed me, and in the midst of fire I was not burnt. From the depth of the belly of hell, and from a defiled tongue, and from the word of lying, from a wicked king, and from an unjust tongue: my soul shall praise our Lord even to death, and my life was approaching to hell beneath. They have compassed me on every side, &amp; there was none that would help. I looked toward the help of men, &amp; there was none. I remembered thy mercy o Lord, and thy operation, which are from the beginning of the world. Because thou deliverest them that patiently expect thee o Lord, and savest them out of the hands of the nations Thou hast exalted my habitation upon the earth, and I have prayed for death to pass away. I have invocated our Lord the father of my Lord, that he leave me not in the day of my tribulation, and in the time of the proud without help. I will praise thy name continually, and will collaud it in confession, and my prayer was heard. And thou hast delivered me from perdition, and hast rescued me from the wicked time. Therefore will I confess, &amp; say praise to thee, and bless the name of our Lord. When I was yet young, before I erred, I sought for wisdom openly in my prayer. Before the temple I prayed for it, and unto the later end I will seek after it, and it shall flourish as the grape timely ripe, my heart hath rejoiced in it, my foot hath walked the right way, from my youth I searched after it. I bowed mine ear a little, and received it. I found much wisdom in myself, &amp; I have much profited therein. To him that giveth me wisdom, will I give glory. For I have consulted to do it: I have had a zeal to good, and shall not be confounded. My soul hath wrestled in it, and in doing it I was confirmed. I stretched forth my hands on high, &amp; I lamented foolishness. I directed my soul to wisdom, and in knowledge I found it. I possessed with it an heart from the beginning: for this cause I shall not be forsaken. My belly was troubled in seeking it: therefore shall I possess a good possession. Our Lord hath given me a tongue for my reward: and with the same I will praise him. Approach unto me ye unlearned, and gather yourselves together into the house of discipline. Why slack ye yet? And what say you herein? Your souls are exceeding thirsty. I have opened my mouth, and have spoken: Buy it for you without silver, and submit your neck to the yoke, and let your soul receive discipline: for it is very near to find it. See with your eyes that I have laboured a little, and have found much rest to myself. Take ye discipline in a great sum of silver, and possess aboundance of gold in it. Let your soul rejoice in his mercy, and you shall not be confounded in praise. Work your work before the time, and he will give you your reward in his time.</div>
