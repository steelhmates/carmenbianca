			<div class='roleText'>Strive not with a mighty man, lest perhaps thou fall into his hands. Contend not with a rich man, lest perhaps he make an action against thee. For gold and silver hath destroyed many, and hath reached even to the heart of kings, and hath turned them. Strive not with a man full of tongue, &amp; thou shalt not heap sticks upon his fire. Communicate not with the ignorant man, lest he speak ill of thy progeny. Despise not a man that turneth himself from sin, nor upbraid him therewith: remember that we are all in state to be blamed. Despise not a man in his old age: for we also shall become old. Rejoice not of thine enemy dead: knowing that we do all die, &amp; would not that others should joy thereat. Despise not the narration of wise ancients, and in their proverbs be thou conversant. For of them thou shalt learn wisdom, and doctrine of understanding, and to serve great men without blame. Let not the narration of the ancients escape thee: for they learned of their fathers: because of them thou shalt learn understanding, and in time of necessity to give answer. Kindle not the coals of sinners rebuking them, and be not kindled with the flame of the fire of their sins. Stand not against the face of a contumelious person, lest he sit as a spy in wait for thy mouth. Lend not to a man mightier than thyself, and if thou doest lend, count it as lost. Be not surety above thy power: and if thou be surety, think as if thou were to pay it. Judge not against a judge: because he judgeth according to that which is just. With the audacious go not on the way, lest perhaps he burden thee with his evils: for he goeth according to his own will, and thou shalt perish together with his folly. With an angry man make no brawl, and with the audacious go not into the desert: because blood is as nothing before him, and where there is no help, he will overthrow thee. Confer no counsel with fools, for they cannot love but such things as please them. Before a stranger do no matter of counsel: for thou knowest not what he will bring forth. Make not thy heart manifest to every man: lest perhaps he repay thee false kindness, and speak reproachfully to thee.</div>
