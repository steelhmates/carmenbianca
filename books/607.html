			<div class='roleText'>To David himself, in the fourth of the sabbath. Our Lord God of revenges: the God of revenges hath done freely. Be exalted thou that judgest the earth: render retribution to the proud. How long shall sinners, o Lord: how long shall sinners glory? Shall they utter, and speak iniquity? Shall all they speak that work injustice? Thy people, o Lord, they have humbled: and thine inheritance they have vexed. The widow, and the stranger they have slain: and the pupils they have killed. And they have said: </div>

And our Lord became my refuge: and my God the help of my hope. And he will repay them their iniquity: and in their malice he will destroy them: the Lord our God will destroy them.</div>
