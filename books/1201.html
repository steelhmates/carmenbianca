			<div class='roleText'>BRETHREN, the will of my heart surely and prayer to God, is for them unto salvation. For I give them testimony that they have zeal of God, but not according to knowledge. For not knowing the justice of God, and seeking to establish their own, they have not been subject to the justice of God. For, the end of the Law is Christ; unto justice to every one that believeth. For Moyses wrote, that, the justice which is of the Law, the man that hath done it, shall live in it. But the justice which is of faith, saith thus: Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into Heaven? that is^ to bring Christ down. Or who descendeth into the depth? that is^ to call Christ again from the dead. But what saith the Scripture? The word is nigh, in thy mouth, and in thy heart. This is the word of faith which we preach. For if thou confess with thy mouth our Lord JESUS, and in thy heart believe that God hath raised him up from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart we believe unto justice; but with the mouth confession is made to salvation. For the Scripture saith: Whosoever believeth in him, shall not be confounded. For there is no distinction of the Jew and the Greek: for one is Lord of all, rich toward all that invocate him. For every one whosoever shall invocate the name of our Lord, shall be saved. How then shall they invocate in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe him whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without a preacher? But how shall they preach unless they be sent? as it is written: How beautiful are the feet of them that evangelize peace, of them that evangelize good things? But all do not obey the Gospel. For Esay saith, Lord, who hath believed the hearing of us? Faith then, is by hearing: and hearing is by the word of Christ. But I say, have they not heard? And certes into all the earth hath the sound of them gone forth: and unto the ends of the whole world the words of them. But I say, hath not Israel known? Moyses first saith: I will bring you to emulation in that which is not a nation: in a foolish nation, I will drive you into anger. But Esay is bold, and saith: I was found of them that did not seek me: openly I appeared to them that asked not of me. But to Israel he saith: All the day have I spread my hands to a people that believeth not, and contradicteth me.</div>
