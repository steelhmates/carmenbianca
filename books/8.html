			<div class='roleText'>And God remembered Noe, and all the beasts, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters decreased. And the fountains of the depth and the flood-gates of heaven were shut up: and the rain from heaven was stayed. And the waters returned from the earth going &amp; coming: and they began to decrease after an hundred fifty days. And the ark rested the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia. But the waters for all that^ were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared. And after that forty days were passed, Noe opening the window of the ark, which he had made, let forth a crow: which went forth, and did not return, till the waters were dried upon the earth. He sent forth also a dove after him, to see if the waters were ceased yet upon the face of the earth. Which finding not where her foot might rest, returned to him into the ark: for the waters were upon the whole earth: and he stretched forth his hand and caught her, and brought her into the ark. And having expected yet seven more days again he let forth a dove out of the ark. But she came to him at eventide, carrying a bough of an olive tree that had green leaves, in her mouth.

			<div class='roleText'>Noe therefore went forth, and his sons: his wife, and the wives of his sons with him. Yea and all cattle, beasts, &amp; creepers that creep upon the earth, according to their kind, went forth out of the ark. And Noe built an Altar to our Lord: and taking of all cattle and fowls that were clean, offered Holocausts upon the Altar. And our Lord smelled a sweet savour, and said: </div>
