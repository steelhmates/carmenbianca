			<div class='roleText'>And God remembered Noe, and all the beasts, and all the cattle which were with him in the ark, and brought a wind upon the earth, and the waters decreased. And the fountains of the depth and the flood-gates of heaven were shut up: and the rain from heaven was stayed. And the waters returned from the earth going &amp; coming: and they began to decrease after an hundred fifty days. And the ark rested the seventh month, the seven and twentieth day of the month, upon the mountains of Armenia. But the waters for all that^ were going and decreasing until the tenth month: for in the tenth month, the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains appeared. And after that forty days were passed, Noe opening the window of the ark, which he had made, let forth a crow: which went forth, and did not return, till the waters were dried upon the earth.
