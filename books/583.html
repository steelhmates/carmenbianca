			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, a Psalm of David, in remembrance, that our Lord saved him. O God intend unto my help: Lord make haste to help me. Let them be confounded and be ashamed, that seek my soul. Let them be turned away backward, and be ashamed that will me evils. Let them be turned away forthwith ashamed, that say to me: Well, well. Let all that seek thee rejoice, and be glad in thee, and let them say always: Our Lord be magnified: which love thy salvation. But I am needy and poor: O God help me, thou art my helper, and deliverer: o Lord be not slack.</div>
