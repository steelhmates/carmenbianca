			<div class='roleText'>Blessed is the man, that hath not gone in the counsel of the impious, &amp; hath not stood in the way of sinners, and hath not sit in the chair of pestilence: But his will is in the way of our Lord, and in his law he will meditate day and night. And he shall be as a tree, that is planted nigh to the streams of waters, which shall give his fruit in his time. And his leaf shall not fall: and all things whatsoever he shall do, shall prosper. The impious not so, not so: but as dust, which the wind driveth from the face of the earth. Therefore the impious shall not rise again in judgment: nor sinners in the Council of the just. For our Lord knoweth the way of the just, and the way of the impious shall perish.</div>
