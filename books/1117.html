And Pilate asked him: Art thou the King of the Jews? but he answering, said to him: Thou sayest, And the chief Priests accused him in many things. And Pilate again asked him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Answerest thou nothing? See in how many things they accuse thee. But JESUS answered nothing more; so that Pilate marveled. And upon the festival day he was wont to release unto them one of the prisoners whomsoever they had demanded. And there was one called Barabbas, which was put in prison with seditious persons, who in a sedition had committed murder. And when the multitude was come up, they began to require, according as always he did unto them. And Pilate answered them, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Will you that I release to you the King of the Jews? For he knew that the chief Priests for envy had delivered him. But the chief Priests moved the people, that he should release Barabbas rather to them. And Pilate again answering, said to them: What will you then that I do to the King of the Jews? But they again cried: Crucify him. And Pilate saith to them: Why, what evil hath he done? But they cried the more: Crucify him. And Pilate willing to satisfy the people, released to them Barabbas, and delivered JESUS, having whipped him, for to be crucified. And the soldiers led him into the court of the Palace, and they call together the whole band: and they clothe him in purple, and platting a crown of thorns, they put it upon him. And they began to salute him: Hail King of the Jews. And they smote his head with a reed: and they did spit on him. And bowing the knees, they adored him. And after they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple, and put on him his own garments, and they lead him forth to crucify him. And they forced a certain man that passed by, Simon a Cyrenean coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to take up his cross. And they bring him into the place Golgotha, which being interpreted is, The place of Calvary. And they gave him to drink wine mingled with myrrh; and he took it not. And crucifying him, they divided his garments, casting lots upon them, who should take which. And it was the third hour, and they crucified him. And the title of his cause was superscribed, KING OF THE JEWS. And with him they crucify two thieves; one on the right hand, and another on his left. And the Scripture was fulfilled that saith: And with the wicked he was reputed. And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Vah, he that destroyeth the Temple, and in three days buildeth it: save thyself, coming down from the cross. In like manner also the chief Priests mocking said with the Scribes one to another: He saved others, himself he cannot save. Let Christ the King of Israel come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. And they that were crucified with him, railed at him. And when it was the sixth hour, there was made darkness upon the whole earth until the ninth hour. And at the ninth hour JESUS cried out with a mighty voice, saying: </div>

And the veil of the temple was rent in two, from the top to the bottom. And the Centurion that stood over against him, seeing that so crying he had given up the ghost, said: </div>

And there were also women looking on^ a far off: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less, and of Joseph, and Salome; and when he was in Galilee, they followed him, and ministered to him, and many other women that came up together with him to Jerusalem. And when evening was now come (because it was the Parasceve, which is the Sabboth-eve) came Joseph of Arimathaea a noble Senator, who himself also was expecting the Kingdom of God; and he went in boldly to Pilate, and asked the body of JESUS. But Pilate marveled if he were now dead. And sending for the Centurion, asked him if he were now dead. And when he understood by the Centurion, he gave the body to Joseph. And Joseph buying sindon, and taking him down, wrapped him in the sindon, and laid him in a monument, that was hewed out of a rock. And he rolled a stone to the door of the monument. And Mary Magdalene and Mary of Joseph beheld where he was laid.</div>
