			<div class='roleText'>And the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy the second time, when as yet he was shut up in the court of the prison, saying: Thus saith our Lord that will do, &amp; will form it, &amp; prepare it, the Lord is his name. Cry unto me, and I will hear thee: and I will tell thee great things, and firm things which thou knowest not. Because thus saith our Lord the God of Israel to the houses of this city, and to the houses of the king of Juda, which are destroyed, &amp; to the munitions, and to the sword. of them that come to fight with the Chaldees, and to fill them with the carcasses of the men, whom I have strucken in my fury, and in mine indignation, hiding my face from this city, because of all their malice. Behold I will bring to them a scar and health, &amp; will cure them: &amp; I will reveal unto them the prayer of peace &amp; truth. And I will convert the conversion of Juda, &amp; the conversion of Jerusalem: and will build them as from the beginning. And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, wherein they have sinned to me: &amp; I will be propitious to all their iniquities, wherein they have sinned to me, &amp; despised me. And it shall be to me a name, &amp; a joy, &amp; a praise, &amp; an exultation to all the nations of the earth, that shall hear all the good things, which I will do to them: and they shall fear, &amp; be troubled in all the good things, &amp; in all the peace, that I will make to them. Thus saith our Lord: Yet there shall be heard in this place (which you say is desolate, because there is neither man nor beast: in the cities of Juda, &amp; without Jerusalem, which are desolate without man, &amp; without inhabiter, and without beast) the voice of joy and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that say: Confess ye to the Lord of hosts, because our Lord is good, because his mercy is for ever: and of them that carry vows into the house of our Lord. For I will bring back the conversion of the land as from the beginning, saith our Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Yet there shall be in this desolate place without man, and without beast, and in all the cities thereof, an habitation of Pastors of the resting flocks. In the cities on the mountains, and in the champion cities, and in the cities that are toward the South: and in the land of Benjamin, and round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda there shall yet pass flocks, at the hand of him that numbereth them, saith our Lord. Behold the days shall come, saith our Lord, &amp; I will raise up the good word, that I have spoken to the house of Israel, and to the house of Juda. In those days, and in that time, I will make the spring of justice to bud forth unto David: and he shall do judgement and justice in the earth. In those days shall Juda be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell confidently: &amp; this is the name, that they shall call him, The Lord our just one. Because thus saith our Lord: There shall not fail of David a man, to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel. And of the Priests and Levites there shall not fail from before my face a man, to offer holocausts, &amp; to burn sacrifice, &amp; to kill victims all days. And the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy, saying: Thus saith our Lord: If my covenant with the day can be made void, &amp; my covenant with the night, that there be not day and night in their time: also my covenant may be made void with David my servant, that there be not of him a son to reign in his throne, &amp; Levites &amp; Priests my ministers. Even as the stars of heaven cannot be numbered, &amp; the sand of the sea be measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites my ministers. And the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy, saying: Hast thou not seen what this people hath spoken, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The two kindreds, which our Lord had chosen, are cast off: and they have despised my people, because it is no more a Nation before them? Thus saith our Lord: If I have not set my covenant between day and night, and laws to heaven and earth: surely I will also cast off the seed of Jacob, and of David my servant, that I take not of his seed Princes of the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. For I will bring back their conversion, and will have mercy on them.</div>
