			<div class='roleText'>The spirit of the Lord upon me, because the Lord hath anointed me: to preach to the mild he sent me, that I should heal the contrite of heart, and preach indulgence to the captives, and deliverance to them that are shut up. That I should preach the placable year to the Lord, &amp; the day of vengeance of our God: that I might comfort all that mourn; that I might appoint to the mourners of Sion, &amp; give them a crown for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, a mantle of praise for the spirit of sorrowfulness: and they shall be called in it the strong of justice, planting of the Lord to glorify. And they shall build the deserts from the beginning of the world, and shall erect the old ruins; and shall repair the desolate cities, that were dissipated in generation and generation. And aliens shall stand, and feed your cattle: and the children shall be your husbandmen, and dressers of the vines. And you shall be called the Priests of the Lord: to you it shall be said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The ministers of our God: you shall eat the strength of the Gentiles, and in their glory you shall be proud. For your double confusion &amp; shame, they shall praise their part: for this cause shall they receive double in their land, everlasting joy shall be to them. Because I am the Lord that love judgement, &amp; hate robbery in holocaust: and I will give their work in truth, and make a perpetual covenant with them. And they shall know their seed in the Gentiles, and their bud in the midst of peoples, all that shall see them, shall know them, that these are the seed which the Lord hath blessed. Rejoicing I will rejoice in our Lord, and my soul shall be joyful in my God: because he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation: and with the garment of justice he hath compassed me, as a bridegroom decked with a crown, and as a bride adorned with her jewels. For as the earth bringeth forth her spring, and as the garden shooteth forth his seed: so shall our Lord God make justice to spring forth, and praise before all the Gentiles.</div>
