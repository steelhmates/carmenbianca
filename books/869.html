			<div class='roleText'>The word that was made to Jeremy from our Lord, saying: Arise and go down into the potter's house, and there thou shalt hear my words. And I went down into the potter's house, and behold he made a work upon the wheel. And the vessel was broken which he made of clay with his hands: and turning he made it another vessel, as it pleased in his eyes to make it. And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Why, shall I not be able to do unto you, as this potter, o house of Israel? Behold, saith our Lord, as clay in the hand of the potter, so are you in my hand, o house of Israel. I will suddenly speak against nation, and against kingdom, to root out, and destroy, and waste it. If that nation shall repent them of their evil, against whom I have spoken: I also will repent me of the evil, that I have thought to do to it. And I will suddenly speak of nation and of kingdom, to build and plant it. If it shall do evil in mine eyes, that it hear not my voice: I will repent me of the good that I have spoken to do unto it. Now therefore tell the man of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>We are desperate: for we will go after our cogitations, and we will do every one the perversity of his evil heart. Therefore thus saith our Lord: Ask the Nations: Who hath heard such horrible things, as the virgin of Israel hath done exceedingly? Why shall the snow of Libanus fail from the rock of the field? Or can the cold waters gushing forth and running down, be drawn out? Because my people hath forgotten me, sacrificing in vain, and stumbling in their ways, in the paths of the world, that they might walk by them in a way not trodden: that their land might be made into desolation, and into an everlasting hiss: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, &amp; wag his head. As the burning wind will I disperse them before the enemy: the back, and not the face will I shew them in the day of their perdition. And they said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Come, and let us find devices against Jeremy: for the law shall not perish from the Priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the Prophet: come, and let us strike him with the tongue, &amp; let us not attend to all his words. Attend o Lord unto me, and hear the voice of mine adversaries. Why, is evil rendered for good, because they have digged a pit for my soul? Remember that I have stood in the sight, to speak good for them, and to return away their indignation from them. Therefore give their children into famine, and lead them into the hands of the sword: let their wives be made without children, and widows: and let the husbands be killed by death: let their young men be pierced through with the sword in battle. Let a cry be heard out of their houses, for thou shalt bring the robber upon them suddenly: because they have digged a pit to take me, and have hid snares for my feet. But thou o Lord knowest all their counsel against me unto death: be not propitious to their iniquity, and let not their sin be clean put out from thy face: let them be made falling in thy sight, in the time of thy fury deal with them.</div>
