			<div class='roleText'>Observe the month of new corn, and the first of the spring time, that thou mayest make the Phase to our Lord thy God: because in this month our Lord thy God brought thee out of Aegypt by night. And thou shalt immolate the Phase to our Lord thy God, of sheep, and of oxen in the place which our Lord thy God shall choose, that his name may dwell there. Thou shalt not eat in it leavened bread: Seven days shalt thou eat without leaven, the bread of affliction, because in fear didst thou come out of Aegypt: that thou mayest remember the day of thy coming out of Aegypt all the days of thy life. Leavened shall not appear in all thy coasts for seven days, and there shall not remain of the flesh of that which was immolated at even the first day until morning. Thou canst not immolate the Phase in every one of thy cities, which our Lord thy God will give thee; but in the place which our Lord thy God shall choose, that his name may dwell there: thou shalt immolate the Phase at even at the going down of the sun, when thou camest out of Aegypt. And thou shalt boil, and eat it in the place, which our Lord thy God shall choose, and in the morning rising up thou shalt go into thy tents. Six days shalt thou eat azymes: and in the seventh day, because it is the collection of our Lord thy God, thou shalt do no work. Seven weeks shalt thou number thee from that day wherein thou didst put the sicle to the corn, and thou shalt celebrate the festival day of weeks to our Lord thy God, a voluntary oblation of thy hand, which thou shalt offer according to the blessing of our Lord thy God: and thou shalt feast before our Lord thy God, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, and thy man servant, and thy woman servant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the stranger and pupil and widow, which abide with you: in the place which our Lord thy God shall choose, that his name may dwell there: and thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in Aegypt: and thou shalt keep and do the things that are commanded. The solemnity also of Tabernacles thou shalt celebrate seven days, when thou hast gathered thy fruit of the barn floor and the press: and thou shalt feast in the festivity, thou, thy son, and thy daughter, thy man servant and woman servant, the Levite also and stranger, and pupil and widow that are within thy gates. Seven days shalt thou celebrate the feasts to our Lord thy God in the place which our Lord shall choose: and our Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy fruits, and in every work of thy hands, and thou shalt be in joy. Three times in a year shall all thy male appear in the sight of our Lord thy God in the place which he shall choose: in the solemnity of Azymes, in the solemnity of weeks, and in the solemnity of Tabernacles. There shall not appear before our Lord any empty: but every one shall offer according to that he hath, according to the blessing of our Lord his God, which he shall give him. Judges and masters shalt thou appoint in all thy gates, which our Lord thy God shall give thee, in every of thy tribes: that they may judge the people with just judgment, and not decline to either part. Thou shalt not accept person, nor gifts: because that gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and change the words of the just. Justly shalt thou pursue that which is just: that thou mayest live and possess the Land, which our Lord thy God shall give thee. Thou shalt plant no grove, nor any tree near the altar of our Lord thy God. Neither shalt thou make nor set to thyself a statue: which thing our Lord thy God hateth.</div>
