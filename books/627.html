			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. In the coming forth of Israel out of Aegypt: of the house of Jacob from the barbarous people. Jewry was made his sanctification, Israel his dominion. The sea saw, and fled: Jordan was turned backward. The mountains leaped as rams: and the little hills as the lambs of sheep. What aileth thee o sea that thou didst fly: and thou o Jordan, that thou was turned backward? Ye mountains leaped as rams, and ye little hills as the lambs of sheep. At the face of our Lord was the earth moved, at the face of the God of Jacob. Who turned the rock into pools of waters, and stony hill into fountains of waters. NOT TO US O LORD, NOT TO US: but to thy name give the glory. For thy mercy, and thy truth: lest at any time the Gentiles say: Where is their God? But our God is in heaven: he hath done all things what soever he would. The idols of the gentiles are silver, and gold, the works of men's hands. They have mouth, and shall not speak: they have eyes, an shall not see. They have ears, and shall not hear: they have nostrils and shall not smell. They have hands, and shall not handle: they have feet, and shall not walk: they shall not cry in their throat. Let them that make them become like to them: and all that have confidence in them. The house of Israel hath hoped in our Lord: he is their helper and their protector. The house of Aaron hath hoped in our Lord: he is their helper and their protector. They that fear our Lord have hoped in our Lord; he is their helper and their protector. Our Lord hath been mindful of us: and hath blessed us. He hath blessed the house of Israel: he hath blessed the house of Aaron. He hath blessed all that fear our Lord, the little with the great. Our Lord add upon you: upon you, &amp; upon your children. Blessed be you of our Lord, which made heaven and earth. The heaven of heaven is to our Lord: but the earth he hath given to the children of men. The dead shall not praise thee, o Lord: nor all they that go down into hell: but we that live do bless our Lord, from this time, and for ever.</div>
