			<div class='roleText'>In that day our Lord will visit with his sore, and great, and strong sword upon Leviathan the serpent, the bar, &amp; upon Leviathan the crooked serpent, and shall kill the whale that is in the sea. In that day the vineyard of pure wine shall sing to it. I^ the Lord that keep it, I will suddenly drink to it: lest perhaps there be visitation against it, night and day I keep it. There is no indignation in me: who will give me to be thorn and brier in battle: to go upon it, to set it on fire together? Or rather shall he hold my strength, shall he make peace with me, shall he make peace with me? They that go in with violence to Jacob, Israel shall flourish and spring, and they shall fill the face of the world with seed. Hath he striken him according to his stroke that struck him? Or as he killed his slain, is he killed? In measure against measure, when it shall be cast off, thou shalt judge it. He hath meditated in his hard spirit during the day of heat. Therefore upon this shall the iniquity be forgiven to the house of Jacob: and this is all the fruit, that the sin thereof be taken away, when he shall have laid all the stones of the altar, as stones of ashes broken, the groves &amp; temples shall not stand. For the defensed city shall be desolate, the beautiful city shall be forsaken, and shall be left as a desert, there shall the calf feed, and there he shall lie, and shall consume the tops thereof. The harvests thereof shall be destroyed in drought, women coming and teaching it: for it is not a wise people, therefore shall not he that made it, have mercy on it: and he that formed it, shall not spare it. And it shall be, in that day our Lord will strike from the channel of the river, even to the torrent of Aegypt, and you shall be gathered together one and one o children of Israel. And it shall be: In that day a sound shall be made with a great trumpet, and they that were lost, shall come from the land of the Assyrians, and that were cast out, from the land of Aegypt, and shall adore our Lord in the holy mount in Jerusalem.</div>
