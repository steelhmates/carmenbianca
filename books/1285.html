			<div class='roleText'>FOR this Melchisedech, the king of Salem, Priest of the God most high, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him: to whom also Abraham divided tithes of all: first indeed by interpretation, the king of justice: &amp; then also king of Salem, which is to say, king of peace, without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God, continueth a Priest for ever. And behold how great this man is, to whom also Abraham the Patriarch gave tithes of the principal things. And certes they of the sons of Levi that take the priesthood have commandment to take tithes of the people according to the Law, that is to say, of their brethren: albeit themselves also issued out of the loins of Abraham. But he whose generation is not numbered among them, took tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises. But without all contradiction, that which is less, is blessed of the better. And here indeed, men that die, receive tithes: but there he hath witness, that he liveth. And (that it may so be said) by Abraham Levi also, which received tithes, was tithed. For as yet he was in his father's loins, when Melchisedech met him. If then consummation was by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the Law) what necessity was there yet another priest to rise according to the order of Melchisedech, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being translated, it is necessary that a translation of the Law also be made. For he on whom these things be said, is of another tribe, of the which, none attended on the altar. For it is manifest that our Lord sprung of Juda: in the which tribe Moyses spake nothing of priests. And yet it is much more evident: if according to the similitude of Melchisedech there arise another priest, which was not made according to the Law of the carnal commandment, but according to the power of life indissoluble. For he witnesseth, That thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedech. Reprobation certes is made of the former commandment, because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof. For the Law brought nothing to perfection, but an introduction of a better hope, by the which we approach to God. And in as much as it is not without an oath, (the other truly without an oath were made priests: but this with an oath, by him that said unto him: Our Lord hath sworn, &amp; it shall not repent him: thou art a Priest for ever) by so much, is JESUS made a surety of a better testament. And the other indeed were made Priests, being many, because that by death they were prohibited to continue: but this, for that he continueth for ever, hath an everlasting priesthood. whereby he is able to save also for ever going by himself to God: always living to make intercession for us. For it was seemly that we should have such a high Priest, holy, innocent, impolluted, separated from sinners, and made higher than the Heavens. which hath not necessity daily (as the Priests) first for his own sins to offer hosts, then for the peoples. For this he did once, in offering himself. For the Law appointeth Priests men that have infirmity: but the word of the oath which is after the Law, the Son for ever perfected.</div>
