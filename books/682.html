			<div class='roleText'>He seeketh occasions that will depart from a friend: he shall ever be subject to reproach. A fool receiveth not the words of prudence: unless thou say those things which are in his heart. The impious when he shall come into the depth of sins, contemneth: but ignominy and reproach follow him. Deep water^ words from the mouth of a man: and a stream overflowing the fountain of wisdom. To accept the person of the impious in judgment is not good, that thou decline from the truth of judgment. The lips of a fool mingle him with strife: and his mouth provoketh brawls. The mouth of a fool is his destruction: and his lips are the ruin of his soul. The words of the double tongued, as it were simple: and the same come even to the inner part of the belly. Fear casteth down the slothful: and the souls of the effeminate shall be hungry. He that is soft and dissolute in his work, is the brother of him that destroyeth his own works. A most strong tower, the name of our Lord: the just runneth to it, and shall be exalted. The substance of the rich man a city of his strength: and as a strong wall compassing him about. Before he be broken, the heart of a man is exalted: and before he be glorified, it is humbled. He that answereth before he hear, sheweth himself to be a fool, and worthy of confusion. The spirit of a man upholdeth his imbecility: but a spirit that is easy to be angry who can sustain? A wise heart shall possess knowledge: and the ear of the wise seeketh doctrine. The gift of a man enlargeth his way, &amp; maketh him room before Princes. The just is first accuser of himself: his friend cometh, and shall search him. Lot suppresseth contradictions, and between the mighty also it determineth. Brother that is holpen of brother, is a strong city: and judgments are as the bars of cities. Of the fruit of man's mouth his belly shall be filled: and the offsprings of his lips shall fill him. Death and life in the hand of the tongue: they that love it, shall eat the fruits thereof. He that hath found a good wife, hath found a good thing, and hath received a pleasure of our Lord. The poor speaketh with supplications, and the rich will speak roughly. A man amiable to society, shall be more friendly than a brother.</div>
