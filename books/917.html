			<div class='roleText'>And he said to me: Son of man, whatsoever thou shalt find^ eat: eat this volume, and going speak to the children of Israel. And I opened my mouth, and he fed me with that volume: and he said to me: Son of man thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this volume, which I give thee. And I did eat it: and it was made in my mouth sweet as honey. And he said to me: Son of man go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them. For not to a people of profound speech, and of an unknown tongue art thou sent, to the house of Israel. Neither to many peoples of profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not hear: and if thou were sent to them, they would hear thee. But the house of Israel will not hear thee: because they will not hear me. For all the house of Israel is of a shameless forehead, &amp; hard hearted. Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces, and thy forehead harder than their foreheads. As the adamant, &amp; as the flint stone have I made thy face: fear them not, neither be afraid of their face: because it is an exasperating house. And he said to me: Son of man, all my words which I speak to thee, take in thy heart, &amp; hear with thine ears: And go, enter into the transmigration, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith our Lord God: if perhaps they will hear, and be quiet. And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion: Blessed be the glory of our Lord from his place, and the voice of the wings of living creatures striking one against another, &amp; the voice of wheels following the living creatures, &amp; the voice of a great commotion. The spirit also lifted me, &amp; took me up: &amp; I went away bitter in the indignation of my spirit: for the hand of our Lord was with me, strengthening me. And I came to the transmigration, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, &amp; I sat where they sat: &amp; I tarried there seven days mourning in the midst of them. And when seven days were passed, the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, a watchman to the house of Israel have I given thee: &amp; thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, &amp; shalt tell it them from me. If when I say to the impious: Dying thou shalt die: thou tell him not, nor speak that he may be turned away from his impious way, and live: the same impious man shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at thy hand. But if thou denounce to the impious, and he be not converted from his impiety, and from his impious way: he verily shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul. Yea &amp; if the just shall be turned from his justice, &amp; shall do iniquity: I will lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die: because thou hast not told him, he shall die in his sin, &amp; his justices which he hath done shall not be in memory: but his blood I will require at thy hand. But if thou warn the just that the just sin not, and he do not sin: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, &amp; thou hast delivered thy soul. And the hand of our Lord was made upon me, and he said to me: Rising go out into the field, and there I will speak with thee. And rising I went out into the field: and behold the glory of our Lord stood there as it were the glory, which I saw by the river Chobar: &amp; I fell on my face: And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spake to me, and said to me: Go in, and be shut up in the midst of thy house. And thou son of man, behold bands are given upon thee, and they shall bind thee in them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them. And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, not as a man controlling: because it is an exasperating house. But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith our Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear: &amp; he that is quiet, let him be quiet, because it is an exasperating house.</div>
