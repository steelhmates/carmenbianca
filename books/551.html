			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of David, in recordation of the sabbath. Lord rebuke me not in thy fury: nor chastise me in wrath. Because thy arrows are fast sticked in me: and thou hast fastened thy hand upon me. There is no health in my flesh at the face of thy wrath: my bones have no peace at the face of my sins. Because mine iniquities are gone over my head: and as a heavy burden are become heavy upon me. My scars are putrefied and corrupted, because of my foolishness. I am become miserable, and am made crooked even to the end: I went sorrowful all the day. Because my loins are filled with illusions: and there is no health in my flesh.

Because I am ready for scourges: and my sorrow is in my sight always: Because I will declare my iniquity: and I will think for my sin. But mine enemies live, and are confirmed over me: and they are multiplied that hate me unjustly. They that repay evil things for good, detracted from me: because I followed goodness. Forsake me not, o Lord my God, depart not from me. Attend unto my help, o Lord the God of my salvation.</div>
