			<div class='roleText'>Hear ye heavens what things I speak, the earth hear the words of my mouth. My doctrine grow together as rain, my speech flow as the dew, as it were a shower upon the herb, and as it were drops upon the grass. Because I will invocate the name of our Lord: give magnificence to our God. The works of God be perfect, and all his ways judgments: God is faithful, and without any iniquity, just and right. They have sinned to him, and not his children in filthiness: a froward and perverse generation, These things doest thou render to our Lord, thou foolish and unwise people? Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made, and created thee? Remember the old days, think upon every generation: ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders, and they will tell thee. When the highest divided the nations: when he separated the sons of Adam, he appointed the limits of people according to the number of the children of Israel. But our Lord's part is his people: Jacob the cord of his inheritance. He found him in a desert land, and a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and kept him as the apple of his eye. As the eagle provoking her young to fly, and hovering over them hath he spread his wings, and he hath taken him, and carried him on his shoulders. Our Lord only was his guide: and there was not with him a strange god. He placed him over an high land: that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone. Butter from the herd, and milk of the sheep, with the fat of lambs, &amp; of rams of the sons of Basan: and buck-goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the blood of the grape most pure. The beloved was made gross, and spurned: made gross, fatted, dilated, he left God his Maker, and departed from God his salvation. They provoked him in strange gods, and in abominations stirred him to anger. They immolated to devils and not to God, to gods, which they knew not: there came new and fresh ones, whom their fathers worshipped not. God that begat thee thou hast forsaken, and hast forgotten our Lord thy creator. Our Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his sons and daughters provoked him. And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider their last: for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful children. They have provoked me in that, which was no God, and have angered me in their vanities: &amp; I will provoke them in that which is no people, and in a foolish nation will I anger them. A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest parts of hell: and shall devour the earth with her spring, and shall burn the foundations of mountains. I will heap evils upon them, and mine arrows I will spend in them. They shall be consumed with famine, &amp; birds shall devour them with most bitter biting: the teeth of beasts will I send upon them, with the fury of those that trail upon the ground, and creep. Without shall the sword devour them, and within fearfulness, the young man and the virgin together, the sucking child with the old man. I said: Where are they? I will make their memory to cease from among man. But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, &amp; would say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things. A nation without counsel is it, and without wisdom. O that they were wise, and understood, and would provide for their last! How should one pursue a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight? Was it not therefore, because their God sold them, and our Lord inclosed them? For our Lord is not as their gods: our enemies also are judges. Of the vineyard of Sodom, is their vineyard, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grape the grape of gall, and the clusters most bitter. The gall of dragons their wine, and the venom of Asps, uncurable. Are not these things laid up with me, and signed in my treasures? Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in time, that their foot may slide: the day of perdition is at hand, and the times make haste to be present. Our Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants: he shall see that their hand is weakened, &amp; the shut-up also have failed, and the residue be consumed. And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they had confidence. Of whose victims they did eat fat, and drank the wine of their libaments: Let them arise, and help you, and protect you in necessity. See ye that I am only, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill, and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. I will lift up my hand to heaven, and will say: I live for ever. If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, &amp; my hand take judgment: I will repay vengeance to mine enemies, and them that hate me will I requite. I will imbrue my arrows with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and captivity, of the bare head of the enemies. You gentiles praise his people, because he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will repay vengeance upon their enemies, and will be propitious to the land of his people. </div>
