And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of great thunder: and the voice which I heard, as of harpers harping on their harps. And they sang as it were a new song before the seat and before the four beasts, and the Seniors, &amp; no man could say the song, but those hundred forty four thousand, that were bought from the earth. These are they which were not defiled with women. For they are virgins. These follow the Lamb whithersoever he shall go. These were bought from among men, the first fruits to God and the Lamb: and in their mouth there was found no lie. For they are without spot before the throne of God. And I saw another Angel flying through the midst of heaven, having the eternal Gospel, to evangelize unto them that sit upon the earth, and upon every nation, and tribe, and tongue, and people; saying with a loud voice: </div>

And the smoke of their torments shall ascend for ever and ever: neither have they rest day and night, which have adored the beast, and his image, and if any man take the character of his name.
