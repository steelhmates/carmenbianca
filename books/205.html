			<div class='roleText'>And all the children of Israel were assembled in Silo, and there they pitched the tabernacle of the testimony, &amp; the Land was subdued to them. But there remained seven tribes of the children of Israel, which as yet had not received their possessions. To whom Josue said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>How long are you slack with cowardness, and enter not to posses the Land, which our Lord the God of your fathers hath given you? Choose of every tribe three men, that I may send them, and they may go and circuit the Land, and mark it out according to the number of every multitude: and report unto me that which they have marked out. Divide unto you the Land into seven parts: let Judas be in the bounds on the south quarter, and the house of Joseph on the North. The Land in the midst between these^ mark out into seven parts: and you shall come hither to me, that before our Lord your God^ I may cast the lot for you: for the Levites' part is not among you, but the priesthood of our Lord is their inheritance. And Gad and Ruben, and the half tribe of Manasses had now received their possessions beyond Jordan at the East side: which Moyses the servant of our Lord gave them. And when the men were risen up, that they might go to mark out the land, Josue commanded them, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Circuit the Land and mark it out, and return to me: that here before our Lord, in Silo I may cast the lot for you. They therefore went on: and going over it, divided it into seven parts, writing it in a volume. And they returned to Josue into the camp in Silo. Who did cast lots before our Lord in Silo, and divided the Land to the children of Israel into seven parts. And first came up the lot of the children of Benjamin by their families, to possess the Land between the children of Judas and the children of Joseph. And their border was against the North from Jordan: going forward by the side of Jericho on the North quarter, and thence Westward rising up unto the mountains, and reaching to the wilderness of Bethaven, and passing through by Luza to the South, the same is Bethel: and goeth down into Ataroth addar unto the mountain, that is on the South of Beth-horon the lower. And it bendeth compassing against the sea, Southward of the mountain that looketh to Beth-horon against the South: and the issues thereof are into Cariath baal, which is called also Cariathiarim, a city of the children of Judas. This is their coast against the sea, toward the West. But on the South from part of Cariathiarim the border issueth forth against the sea, and cometh to the fountain of the waters of Nephtoa. And it goeth down into part of the mountain that looketh toward the Valley of the children of Ennom: and is against the North quarter in the uttermost part of the Valley Raphaim. And it goeth down into Gehennom (that is, the valley of Ennom) by the side of the Jebusite to the South: and cometh to the Fountain of Rogel, passing to the North, and going forth to Ensemes, that is to say, the fountain of the sun: and it passeth unto the little hills, that are against the ascent of Adommim: and goeth down to Abenboen, that is, the stone of Boen the son of Ruben: and it passeth on the North side to the champion countries: and goeth down into the plain, and passeth by against the North of Bethagla: and the issues thereof are against the brink of the most salt sea on the North in the end of Jordan to the south quarter: which is the border thereof on the East. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin by their borders round about, and their families. And their cities were, Jericho and Beth hagla and Vallis Casis, Beth Araba and Samaraim and Bethel, and Avim and Aphara and Ophera, Town Emona and Ophni and Gabee: twelve cities, &amp; their towns. Gabaon and Rama and Beroth, and Mesphe, and Caphara, and Amosa, and Recem, Iarephel and Tharela, and Sela, Eleph, and Jebus, which is Jerusalem, Gabaath and Cariath: fourteen cities, and their towns. This is the possession of the children of Benjamin by their families.</div>
