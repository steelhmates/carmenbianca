			<div class='roleText'>Therefore when all these words shall be come upon thee, the blessing or cursing, which I have set forth before thee: and thou be touched with repentance of thy heart in all nations, into which our Lord thy God dispersed thee, and shalt return to him, and obey his commandments, as I this day command thee, with thy children in all thy heart, &amp; in all thy soul: our Lord thy God will bring thee again from thy captivity, and have mercy upon thee, and gather thee again out of all the peoples, into which he dispersed thee before. If thou be dispersed as far as the poles of heaven, thence will our Lord thy God draw thee back. and will take thee to him, and bring thee into the Land, which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt obtain it: and blessing thee will make thee to be of a greater number, than were thy fathers. Our Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed: that thou mayest love our Lord thy God in all thy heart, and in all thy soul, that thou mayest live. And all these curses he will turn upon thine enemies, &amp; them that hate and persecute thee. But thou shalt return, and hear the voice of our Lord thy God, &amp; shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this day: and our Lord will make thee abound in all the works of thy hands, in the issue of thy womb, and in the fruit of thy cattle, in the fertility of thy ground, and in the plenty of things. For our Lord will return to rejoice upon thee in all riches, as he rejoiced in thy fathers: yet so, if thou hear the voice of our Lord thy God, and keep his precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law: and return to our Lord thy God in all thy heart, and in all thy soul. This commandment, that I command thee this day, is not above thee, nor so far off, nor situated in heaven that thou mayest say: Which of us is able to ascend unto heaven to bring it to us, that we may hear and fulfill it in work? nor placed beyond the sea: that thou mayest pretend, and say: Which of us can pass over the sea and bring it even unto us, that we may hear, &amp; do that which is commanded? But the word is very near thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, to do it. Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and contrarywise death and evil: that thou mayest love our Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments: and thou mayest live, and he multiply thee, and bless thee in the Land which thou shalt enter to possess. But if thy heart be averted, and thou wilt not hear, and deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and serve them: I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish, &amp; abide a little time in the Land, which passing over Jordan, thou shalt enter to possess. I call for witnesses this day heaven &amp; earth, that I have proposed to you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therefore life, that both thou mayest live, and thy seed: and mayest love our Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and cleave to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days) that thou mayest live in the Land, for the which our Lord sware to thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it them.</div>
