			<div class='roleText'>In the ninth year of Sedecias the king of Juda, the tenth month, came Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, &amp; all his army to Jerusalem, and they besieged it. And in the eleventh year of Sedecias, the fourth month, the fifth of the month the city was opened. And all the Princes of the king of Babylon went in, &amp; sat in the middle gate: Neregal, Sereser, Semegarnabu, Sarsachim, Rabsares, Neregel, Serezer, Rebmag, &amp; all the rest of the Princes of the king of Babylon. And when Sedecias the king of Juda, &amp; all the men of war had seen them, they fled: &amp; they went forth in the night out of the city by the way of the king's garden, and by the gate, that was between the two walls, &amp; they went out to the way of the desert.
