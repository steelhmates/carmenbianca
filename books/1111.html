And his garments were made glistering and white exceedingly as snow, the like whereof a fuller cannot make white upon the earth.

And whosoever shall scandalize one of these little ones believing in me; it is good for him rather if a millstone were put about his neck, and he were cast into the sea. And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it off. It is good for thee to enter into life, maimed, than having two hands^ to go into hell, into the fire unquenchable, where their worm dieth not, and the fire quencheth not. And if thy foot scandalize thee, chop it off. It is good for thee to enter into life everlasting, lame, rather than having two feet, to be cast into the hell of unquenchable fire, where their worm dieth not, and the fire quencheth not. And if thine eye scandalize thee, cast it out. It is good for thee with one eye to enter into the Kingdom of God, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into the hell of fire, where their worm dieth not, and the fire quencheth not. For every one shall be salted with fire: and every victim shall be salted with salt. Salt is good. But if the salt shall be unseasoned; wherewith will you season it? Have salt in you, and have peace among you.</div>
