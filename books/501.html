			<div class='roleText'>Job also added, taking his parable, and said: Who will grant me, that I may be according to the former months, according to the days in which God kept me? When his lamp shined over my head, &amp; I walked by his light in darkness? As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle? When the Omnipotent was with me: and my servants round about me? When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured the rivers of oil? When I went forth to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair? Young men saw me, and hid themselves: and old men rising up stood. The Princes ceased to speak, and did put the finger upon their mouth. Dukes held in their voice, and their tongue cleaved to their throat.

To my words they durst add nothing, and my speech distilled upon them. They expected me as rain, and they opened their mouth as it were to a lateward shower. If at any time I laughed on them, they believed not, and the light of my countenance fell not on the earth. If I would have gone to them, I sat first, and when I sat as a king with his army standing about him, yet was I a comforter of them that mourned.</div>
