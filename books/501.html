			<div class='roleText'>Job also added, taking his parable, and said: Who will grant me, that I may be according to the former months, according to the days in which God kept me? When his lamp shined over my head, &amp; I walked by his light in darkness? As I was in the days of my youth, when God was secretly in my tabernacle? When the Omnipotent was with me: and my servants round about me? When I washed my feet with butter, and the rock poured the rivers of oil? When I went forth to the gate of the city, and in the street they prepared me a chair? Young men saw me, and hid themselves: and old men rising up stood. The Princes ceased to speak, and did put the finger upon their mouth. Dukes held in their voice, and their tongue cleaved to their throat.
