			<div class='roleText'>And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and thou shalt prophesy to them, and shalt say: Mountains of Israel hear ye the word of our Lord God: Thus saith our Lord God to the mountains, and little hills, and to the rocks, &amp; the valleys: Behold I will bring upon you the sword, and will destroy your excelses, and cast down your altars, and your idols shall be broken: and I will overthrow your slain before your idols. And I will lay the carcasses of the children of Israel before the face of your idols: and I will disperse your bones about your altars in all your habitations. The cities shall be desolate, and the excelses shall be cast down, and destroyed, and your altars shall perish, and shall be broken: and your idols shall cease, &amp; your temples shall be destroyed, &amp; your works shall be defaced. And the slain shall fall in the midst of you: &amp; you shall know that I am the Lord. And I will leave in you them, that shall escape the sword in the Gentiles, when I shall disperse you in the lands. And your delivered shall remember me amongst the Gentiles, to which they are led in captivity: because I have broken their heart fornicating, and revolting from me: &amp; their eyes fornicating after their idols: and they shall mislike with themselves upon the evils which they had done in all their abominations. And they shall know that I^ the Lord have not spoken in vain to do them this evil. Thus saith our Lord God: Strike thy hand, and knock thy foot, and say: Alas, to all the abominations of the evils of the house of Israel: because they shall fall by sword, famine, and pestilence. He that is far off, shall die with pestilence: and he that is near, shall fall by the sword: and he that shall be left, and besieged, shall die for famine: and I will accomplish mine indignation in them. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain shall be amongst the midst of your idols, in the circuit of your altars, in every high hill, and in all the tops of mountains, and under every woody tree, and under every oak with thick branches, the place where they burnt frankincense smelling sweetly to all their idols. And I will stretch forth my hand upon them: and will make the land desolate, and destitute from the desert of Deblatha in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the Lord.</div>
