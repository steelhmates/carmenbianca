			<div class='roleText'>Moyses my servant is dead: arise, and pass over this Jordan thou and all the people with thee into the Land, which I will give to the children of Israel. Every place the step of your foot shall tread, will I deliver to you, as I have spoken to Moyses. From the desert and Libanus unto the great river Euphrates, all the land of the Hetheites unto the great sea against the going down of the sun, shall be your border. No man shall be able to resist you all the days of thy life: as I have been with Moyses, so will I be with thee: I will not leave nor forsake thee. Take courage, and be strong: for thou shalt by lot divide to this people the Land, for the which I sware to their fathers, that I would deliver it to them. Take courage therefore, and be very strong: that thou keep and do all the Law, which Moyses my servant hath commanded thee: decline not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayest understand all things which thou doest. Let not the volume of this law depart from thy mouth: but thou shalt meditate in it days and nights, that thou mayest keep and do all things that be written in it: then shalt thou direct thy way, and understand it. Behold I command thee, take courage, and be strong. Fear not, and dread not: because the Lord thy God is with thee in all the things to whatsoever thou shalt go. </div>
