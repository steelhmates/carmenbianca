Your wives, and children, and cattle shall tarry in the Land, which Moyses delivered to you beyond Jordan: but pass you over armed before your brethren, all that are strong of hand, and fight for them, until our Lord give rest to your brethren, as to you also he hath given, and they also possess the Land which our Lord your God will give them: and so return into the Land of your possession, &amp; you shall dwell in it, which Moyses the servant of our Lord gave you beyond Jordan, against the rising of the sun.
