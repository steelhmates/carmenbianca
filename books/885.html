			<div class='roleText'>The word that was made to Jeremy from our Lord when Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, &amp; all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth that were under the power of his hand, and all the peoples made war against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof, saying: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: Go, and speak to Sedecias the king of Juda: &amp; thou shalt say to him: Thus saith our Lord: Behold I will deliver this city into the hands of the king of Babylon, &amp; he shall burn it with fire. And thou shalt not escape out of his hand: but by taking thou shalt be taken, and thou shalt be delivered into his hand: and thine eyes shall see the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak with thy mouth, &amp; thou shalt enter into Babylon. But yet hear the word of our Lord o Sedecias king of Juda: Thus saith our Lord to thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword, but thou shalt die in peace, &amp; according to the burnings of thy fathers the former kings that have been before thee, so shall they burn thee: &amp;, Alas lord, shall they mourn for thee: because I have spoken the word, saith our Lord. And Jeremy the Prophet spake all these words to Sedecias the king of Juda in Jerusalem. And the army of the king of Babylon fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Juda, that were remaining, against Lachis, and against Azecha: for these remained of the cities of Juda, fenced cities. The word that was made to Jeremy from our Lord, after that king Sedecias made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem, proclaiming: That every one should dismiss his servant, and every one his handmaid; the Hebrew man &amp; the Hebrew woman free: And that they should not have dominion over them, that is, on a Jew and his brother. All the Princes therefore heard, and all the people which had made the covenant that every man should dismiss his servant, and every man his handmaid free, and should no more have dominion over them: they heard therefore, and dismissed them. And they turned afterwards: and drew their servants and their handmaids back again, whom they had dismist free, and brought them into subjection as men servants, and women servants. And the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy from our Lord, saying: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: I made a covenant with your fathers in the day, that I brought them out of the Land of Aegypt, from the house of bondage, saying: When seven years shall be accomplished, let every man dismiss his brother an Hebrew, that was sold to him, and he shall serve thee six years: and thou shalt dismiss him free from thee: and your fathers have not heard me, nor inclined their ear. And you were converted this day, &amp; did that which is right in mine eyes, that you proclaimed liberty every one to his friend: and you made a covenant in my sight, in the house, wherein my name is invocated upon it. And you are returned, and have defiled my name: and you have brought back again every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom you had dismist to be free, and of their own jurisdiction: and you have brought them into subjection to be your servants and handmaids. Therefore thus saith our Lord: You have not heard me, to proclaim liberty every man to his brother, and every one to his friend: behold I proclaim unto you liberty, saith our Lord, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to famine: and I will give you into commotion to all the kingdoms of the earth. And I will give the men, that transgress my covenant, and have not observed the words of the covenant, whereunto they consented in my sight, the calf which they did cut into two parts, and passed between the divisions thereof: The Princes of Juda and the Princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the Priests, and all the people of the land that passed between the divisions of the calf. And I will give them into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their life: and their carcass shall be for meat to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth. And Sedecias the king of Juda, and his Princes I will give into the hands of their enemies, and into the hands of them that seek their lives, and into the hands of the armies of the king of Babylon, which are retired from you. Behold I command, saith our Lord, and I will bring them again into this city, and they shall fight against it, and take it, &amp; burn it with fire: and the cities of Juda I will give into desolation, because there is not an inhabiter.</div>
