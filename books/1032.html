And Sarasar, and Rogommelech, and the men that were with him, sent to the house of God, to beseech the face of our Lord: that they should say to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the Prophets, saying: </div>

And the widow, and the pupil, and the stranger, and the poor do not calumniate: and let not a man think in his heart evil to his brother. And they would not attend, and they turned away the shoulder departing: and they aggravated their ears, not to hear. And they made their heart as the adamant, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord sent in his spirit by the hand of the former Prophets: and there was great indignation made from the Lord of hosts. And it came to pass as he spake, and they heard not: so shall they cry, and I will not hear, saith the Lord of hosts. And I dispersed them throughout all kingdoms, which they knew not: and the land was left desolate of them, for that there was none passing and returning: and the land to be desired they laid into a desert.</div>
