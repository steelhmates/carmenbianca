And Sarasar, and Rogommelech, and the men that were with him, sent to the house of God, to beseech the face of our Lord: that they should say to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts, and to the Prophets, saying: </div>

And they made their heart as the adamant, lest they should hear the law, and the words which the Lord sent in his spirit by the hand of the former Prophets: and there was great indignation made from the Lord of hosts.
