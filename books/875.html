And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: As are these good figs: so will I know the transmigration of Juda, which I have sent forth out of this place into the land of Chaldees, unto good. And I will set mine eyes upon them to be pacified, and I will bring them again into this land: and I will build them, and not destroy: and I will plant them and not pluck them up. And I will give them an heart to know me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be my people, &amp; I will be their God: because they shall return to me in all their heart. And as are the very naughty figs, that cannot be eaten, because they are naught: thus saith our Lord, so will I give Sedecias the king of Juda: and his Princes, and the rest of Jerusalem, that have remained in this city, and that dwell in the Land of Aegypt. And I will give them into vexation, and affliction, to all the kingdoms of the earth: into reproach, and to be a parable, and into a proverb, and into malediction in all places, to which I have cast them out. And I will send among them the sword, famine, and pestilence: till they be consumed out of the land, which I gave them, and their fathers.</div>
