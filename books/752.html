			<div class='roleText'>He that liveth for ever, created all things together. God only shall be justified, and remaineth an invincible King for ever. Who is sufficient to declare his works? For who shall search out his glorious things? and who shall shew forth the power of his greatness? Or who shall add to declare his mercy? It is not possible to diminish, nor add, neither is it possible to find the glorious works of God: When a man, shall have done, then shall he begin: and when he shall rest, he shall work. What is man: and what is his grace? And what is his good, or what his evil? The number of the days of men at the most an hundred years: as drops of the water of the sea they are reputed: and as the gravel stone of the sand, so a few years in the day of eternity. For this cause God is patient toward them, and poureth out his mercy upon them. He hath seen the presumption of their heart that it is naught, and hath known their subversion that it is evil. Therefore hath he fulfilled his propitiation toward them, and hath shewed them the way of equity. Man's compassion is touching his neighbour: but the mercy of God is upon all flesh. He that hath mercy, teacheth and instructeth, as a pastor his flock. He hath mercy on him that receiveth the doctrine of compassion, and he that hasteneth in his judgements. Son in good deeds give no blame, &amp; in every gift give not the sadness of an evil word. Shall not the dew cool heat? So also a word better than a gift. Is not a word above a good gift? But both are with a justified man. A fool will upbraid bitterly: and the gift of one untaught maketh the eyes to dry away. Before judgment prepare thee justice, and before thou speak^ learn. Before sickness take medicine, and before judgement examine thyself, and in the sight of God thou shalt find propitiation. Before sickness humble thyself, and in time of infirmity shew thy conversation. Be not hindered to pray always, &amp; fear not to be justified even to death, because the reward of God abideth for ever. Before prayer prepare thy soul: and be not as a man that tempteth God. Remember the wrath in the day of consummation, and the time of reward in conversation of the face. Remember poverty in the time of aboundance, &amp; the necessities of poverty in the day of riches. From morning unto evening time shall be changed, &amp; all these are sown in the eyes of God. A wise man in all things will fear, and in the days of offences will beware of sloth. Every subtile man knoweth wisdom, and to him that findeth her he will give praise. The wise in words, and they also have done wisely: and have understood truth and justice, and have rained proverbs &amp; judgments. Go not after thy concupiscences, and turn away from thy will. If thou give to thy soul her concupiscences, she will make thee a joy to thy enemies. Be not delighted in multitudes, nor in few: for their concertation is continual. Be not poor in contention of borrowing, and thou hast nothing in thy purse: for thou shalt be envious to thine own life.</div>
