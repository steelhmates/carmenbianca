			<div class='roleText'>Speak to Aaron thy brother, that he enter not at all times into the Sanctuary, that is within the veil before the propitiatory, wherewith the ark is covered, lest he die (for in a cloud will I appear over the oracle) unless he do these things before: He shall offer a calf for sin, and a ram for an holocaust. He shall be revested with a linen tunic, he shall hide his privities with linen femorals: he shall be girded with a linen girdle, a linen mitre shall he put upon his head: for these are holy vestments: with all which, when he is washed, he shall be revested. And he shall receive of the whole multitude of the children of Israel two buck goats for sin, and one ram for an holocaust. And when he hath offered the calf, and prayed for himself, and for his own house, he shall make the two buck goats to stand before the Lord in the door of the tabernacle of testimony: and casting lots upon both, one for the Lord, &amp; another for the goat of dismission: that, whose lot fell to the Lord, he shall offer for sin: but that, whose lot was to be the goat of dismission, he shall set alive before the Lord that he may pour out prayers upon him, and dismiss him into the wilderness. After that these things be duly celebrated, he shall offer the calf, &amp; praying for himself and for his house, he shall immolate it: and taking the thurible, which he hath filled of the burning coals of the altar, and taking up with his hand of the compounded perfume for incense, he shall go in beyond the veil into the Holy place: that when the incense is put upon the fire, the cloud thereof and the vapour may cover the oracle, which is over the testimony, and he die not. He shall take also of the blood of the calf, and sprinkle with his finger seven times against the propitiatory to the east. And when he hath killed the buck goat for the sin of the people, he shall carry in the blood thereof within the veil, as hath been commanded of the blood of the calf, that he may sprinkle it against the oracle, and expiate the Sanctuary from the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and from their prevarications, and all their sins. According to this rite shall he do to the tabernacle of testimony, which is fixed among them in the midst of the filth of their habitation. Let not man be in the tabernacle when the high-Priest goeth into the Sanctuary, to pray for himself and for his house, &amp; for the whole assembly of Israel, until he come forth. And when he is come forth to the altar that is before the Lord, let him pray for himself, and taking the blood of the calf, and the buck goat, let him pour it upon the horns thereof round about: and sprinkling with his finger seven times, let him expiate, and sanctify it from the uncleanness of the children of Israel. After he hath cleansed the Sanctuary, and the tabernacle, and the altar, then let him offer the live goat: and putting both hands upon his head, let him confess all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their offences and sins: which praying to light on his head, he shall send him forth by a man ready thereto, into the desert. And when the goat hath carried all their iniquities into the solitary ground, and shall be let go into the desert, Aaron shall return into the tabernacle of testimony, and putting off the vestments, which he had on him before when he entered into the Sanctuary, and leaving them there, he shall wash his flesh in a holy place, and shall be clothed with his own garments. And after that he hath gone forth &amp; offered his own holocaust, and the people's, he shall pray as well for himself, as for the people: and the fat, that is offered for sins, he shall burn upon the altar, but he that hath let go the goat of dismission, shall wash his cloths and body with water, and so shall enter into the camp. But the calf &amp; the buck goat, that were immolated for sin, and whose blood was carried into the Sanctuary, to accomplish the expiation, they shall carry forth without the camp, and shall burn with fire as well the skins as their flesh, and the dung: and whosoever burneth them, shall wash his cloths and his flesh with water, &amp; so shall enter into the camp. And this shall be to you an everlasting ordinance. The seventh month, the tenth day of the month you shall afflict your souls, and no work shall you do, whether he be of the same country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you. Upon this day shall be the expiation of you, and cleansing from all your sins: before the Lord you shall be cleansed, for it is a sabbath of rest, &amp; you shall afflict your souls by a perpetual religion. And the Priest shall expiate, that is anointed, &amp; whose hands are consecrated to do the function of priesthood for his father: &amp; he shall be revested with the linen stole &amp; the holy vestments, &amp; he shall expiate the Sanctuary &amp; the tabernacle of testimony &amp; the altar, the Priests also &amp; all the people. And this shall be an ordinance for ever, that you pray for the children of Israel, and for all their sins once in a year. </div>
