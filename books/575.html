			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for Idithun a Psalm of David. Shall not my soul be subject to God? For of him is my salvation. For he is my God, and my saviour: my receiver, I shall be moved no more. How long set you violently upon a man: you all do kill, as it were upon a wall that is leaning, and a wall shaken. But yet they thought to repel my price. I ran in thirst: they blessed with their mouth, and cursed with their heart. But yet my soul be thou subject to God: because my patience is from him. Because he is my God, and my saviour: my helper I shall not remove. In God is my salvation, and my glory: the God of my help, and my hope is in God. Hope in him all ye the congregation of people: pour out your hearts before him: God is our helper for ever. But yet the children of men are vain, the children of men are liars in balances: that they may deceive by vanity together. Hope not in iniquity, and covet not robberies: if riches abound set not your heart upon them. Once hath God spoken, these two things have I heard: That power is God's, and mercy, o Lord, is to thee: because thou wilt render to every one according to his works.</div>
