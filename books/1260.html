			<div class='roleText'>FOR the rest therefore, brethren, we desire and beseech you in our Lord JESUS, that as you have received of us how you ought to walk, and to please God, as also you do walk, that you abound more. For you know what precepts I have given to you by our Lord JESUS. For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from fornication, that every one may know to possess his vessel in sanctification and honour: not in the passion of lust, as also the Gentiles that know not God, and that no man over-go, nor circumvent his brother in business: because our Lord is revenger of all these things, as we have foretold you, and have testified. For God hath not called us into uncleanness, but into sanctification. Therefore he that despiseth these things, despiseth not man but God, who also hath given his holy Spirit in us. But concerning the charity of the Fraternity, we have no need to write to you: For yourselves have learned of God to love one another. Yea and you do it toward all the brethren in all Macedonia. But we desire you, brethren, that you abound more: and that you employ your endeavour to be quiet, and that you do your own business, and work with your own hands, as we have commanded you: and that you walk honestly toward them that are without; and need nothing of any man's. And we will not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them that sleep, that you be not sorrowful, as also others that have no hope. For if we believe that JESUS died and rose again, so also God^ them that have slept^ by JESUS^ will bring with him. For this we say to you in the word of our Lord, that we which live, which are remaining in the advent of our Lord, shall not prevent them that have slept. For our Lord himself in commandment, and in the voice of an Archangel, &amp; in the trumpet of God will descend from heaven: and the dead that are in Christ, shall rise again first. Then we that live, that are left, withal shall be taken up with them in the clouds to meet Christ, into the air, and so always we shall be with our Lord. Therefore comfort ye one another in these words.</div>
