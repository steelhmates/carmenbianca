			<div class='roleText'>AND I (brethren) when I came to you, I came not in loftiness of speech or of wisdom, preaching to you the testimony of Christ. For I judged not myself to know any thing among you but JESUS Christ, and him crucified. And I was with you in infirmity, and fear and much trembling: and my speech and my preaching was not in the persuasible words of human wisdom, but in shewing of spirit and power; that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. But we speak wisdom among the perfect. But the wisdom not of this world, neither of the princes of this world, that come to naught: but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, which is hid, which God did predestinate before the worlds, unto our glory: which none of the princes of this world did know: for if they had known, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory. But as it is written: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>But to us God hath revealed by his Spirit. For the Spirit searcheth all things, yea the profundities of God. For what man knoweth the things of a man, but the spirit of a man that is in him? so the things also that are of God no man knoweth, but the spirit of God. And we have received not the spirit of this world, but the spirit that is of God: that we may know the things that of God are given to us. Which also we speak not in learned words of human wisdom; but in the doctrine of the Spirit, comparing spiritual things to the spiritual. But the sensual man perceiveth not those things that are of the Spirit of God. For it is foolishness to him, and he cannot understand; because he is spiritually examined. But the spiritual man judgeth all things: and himself is judged of no man. For who hath known the sense of our Lord that may instruct him? But we have the sense of Christ.</div>
