And he went down to him after certain years into Samaria: at whose coming Achab killed muttons and oxen very many for him and the people that came with him: &amp; he persuaded him to go up into Ramoth Galaad. And Achab the king of Israel said to Josaphat the king of Juda: Come with me into Ramoth Galaad. To whom he answered: As I am^ thou also: as thy people, so my people also: and we will be with thee in battle. Josaphat said to the king of Israel: Consult I beseech thee presently the word of our Lord. Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of the Prophets four hundred men, &amp; said to them: Shall we go into Ramoth Galaad to fight, or sit still? But they said: </div>

Moreover the king of Israel, and Josaphat the king of Juda, both sat in their thrones, clothed with kingly attire, and they sat in the court beside the gate of Samaria, and all the Prophets prophesied before them.
