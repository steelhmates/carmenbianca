And he went down to him after certain years into Samaria: at whose coming Achab killed muttons and oxen very many for him and the people that came with him: &amp; he persuaded him to go up into Ramoth Galaad. And Achab the king of Israel said to Josaphat the king of Juda: Come with me into Ramoth Galaad. To whom he answered: As I am^ thou also: as thy people, so my people also: and we will be with thee in battle. Josaphat said to the king of Israel: Consult I beseech thee presently the word of our Lord. Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of the Prophets four hundred men, &amp; said to them: Shall we go into Ramoth Galaad to fight, or sit still? But they said: </div>
