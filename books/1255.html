			<div class='roleText'>THEREFORE if you be risen with Christ, seek the things that are above; where Christ is sitting on the right hand of God. Mind the things that are above, not the things that are upon the earth. For you are dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God. When Christ shall appear, your life; then you also shall appear with him in glory. Mortify therefore your members that are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence, and avarice, which is the service of idols. For which things the wrath of God cometh upon the children of incredulity. In which you also walked sometime, when you lived in them. But now lay you also all away anger, indignation, malice, blasphemy, filthy talk out of your mouth. Lie not one to another: spoiling yourselves of the old man with his acts, and doing on the new, him that is renewed unto knowledge, according to the image of him that created him. Where there is not, Gentile &amp; Jew, circumcision and prepuce, Barbarous and Scythian, bond and free: but all, and in all Christ. Put ye on therefore as the elect of God, holy, and beloved, the bowels of mercy, benignity, humility, modesty, patience, supporting one another, &amp; pardoning one another, if any have a quarrel against any man. As also our Lord hath pardoned us: so you also. But above all these things have charity, which is the band of perfection: and let the peace of Christ exult in your hearts, wherein also you are called in one body: and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you aboundantly, in all wisdom: teaching and admonishing your own selves, with psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles, in grace singing in your hearts to God. All whatsoever you do in word or in work, all things in the name of our Lord JESUS Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Women be subject to your husbands, as it behoveth in our Lord. Men, love your wives: and be not bitter toward them. Children obey your parents in all things: for that is well pleasing to our Lord. Fathers, provoke not your children to indignation; that they become not discouraged. Servants, obey in all things, your masters according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men, but in simplicity of heart, fearing God. Whatsoever you do, work it from the heart as to our Lord, and not to men: knowing that you shall receive of our Lord the retribution of inheritance. Serve our Lord Christ. For he that doeth injury, shall receive that which he hath done unjustly: and there is not acception of persons with God.</div>
