			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of David, when Absalom his son persecuted him. Lord hear my prayer: with thine ears receive my petition in thy truth: hear me in thy justice. And enter not into judgment with thy servant: because no man living shall be justified in thy sight. Because the enemy hath persecuted my soul: he hath humbled my life in the earth. He hath set me in obscure places as the dead of the world: and my spirit is in anguish upon me, within me my heart is troubled. I was mindful of old days, I have meditated in all thy works: in the facts of thy hands did I meditate. I have stretched forth my hands to thee: my soul is as earth without water unto thee. Hear me quickly, o Lord: my spirit hath fainted. Turn not away thy face from me: and I shall be like to them that descend into the lake. Make me hear thy mercy in the morning: because I have hoped in thee. Make the way known to me, wherein I may walk: because I have lifted up my soul to thee. Deliver me from mine enemies, o Lord, to thee I have fled: teach me to do thy will, because thou art my God. Thy good spirit will conduct me into the right way: for thy name sake, o Lord, thou wilt quicken me in thine equity. Thou wilt bring forth my soul out of tribulation: and in thy mercy thou wilt destroy mine enemies. And thou wilt destroy all that afflict my soul: because I am thy servant.</div>
