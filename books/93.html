			<div class='roleText'>And if his oblation be an host of pacifics, and he will offer of beeves, male or female, without spot shall he offer them before our Lord. And shall lay his hand upon the head of his victim, which shall be immolated in the entire of the tabernacle of testimony, &amp; the sons of Aaron the Priest shall pour the blood in the circuit of the altar. And they shall offer of the host of pacifics, for an oblation to our Lord, the fat that covered the entrails, and whatsoever fat is within: the two kidneys with the fat wherewith the guts are covered, and the caul of the liver with the two little kidneys. And they shall burn them upon the altar, for an holocaust, putting fire under the wood: for an oblation of most sweet savour to our Lord. But if his oblation, and the host of pacifics be of flocks, whether he offer male, or female, they shall be without spot. If he offer a lamb before our Lord, he shall put his hand upon the head of his victim; which shall be immolated in the entire of the tabernacle of testimony: and the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof in the circuit of the altar. And they shall offer of the host of pacifics, a sacrifice to our Lord: the fat and the whole rump, with the kidneys, and the fat that covereth the belly and all the vital parts, and both little kidneys, with the fat that is about the guts, and the caul of the liver with the two little kidneys. And the Priest shall burn them upon the altar, to the food of the fire, and of the oblation of our Lord. If his oblation be a goat, and he offer it to our Lord, he shall put his hand upon the head thereof: and shall immolate it in the entire of the tabernacle of testimony. And the sons of Aaron shall pour the blood thereof in the circuit of the altar. And they shall take of it to the food of our Lord's fire, the fat that covereth the belly, and that covereth all the vital parts: the two little kidneys with the caul, that is upon them about the guts, and the tallow of the liver with the little kidneys: and the Priest shall burn them upon the altar, to the food of the fire, and of the most sweet savour. All the fat shall be our Lord's by a perpetual right in your generations, and in all your habitations: you shall eat no blood nor fat at all.</div>
