			<div class='roleText'>Write the vision, and make it plain upon tables: that he which runneth may read it over. Because as yet the vision is far, and it shall appear at the end, and shall not lie: if he shall make tarriance, expect him: because coming he will come, and he will not slack. Behold he that is incredulous, his soul shall not be right in himself: but the just shall live in his faith. And as wine deceiveth him that drinketh: so shall the proud man be, and he shall not be beautified: who as it were hell, hath dilated his soul: and himself as death, and he is not filled: and he hath gathered together unto him all nations, and hath heaped together unto him all peoples. Why, shall not all these take up a parable upon him, and a speech of obscure sayings of him: and it be said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Woe to him that multiplieth things not his own? How long also doth he aggravate against himself thick clay? Why, shall they not rise suddenly, that shall bite thee? And they shall tear thee, be raised up, and thou be for a spoil to them? Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all that shall be left of the peoples shall spoil thee: for the blood of man, and the iniquity of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell therein. Woe to him that gathereth together naughty avarice to his house, that his nest may be on high, and thinketh he is delivered out of the hand of evil. Thou hast thought confusion to thy house, thou hast cut in sunder many peoples, and thy soul hath sinned. Because the stone out of the wall shall cry: and the timber, that is between the junctures of the buildings, shall answer. Woe to him that buildeth a city in bloods, and prepareth a city in iniquity. Why, are not these things from the Lord of hosts? For the peoples shall labour in much fire: and the nations in vain, and they shall faint. Because the earth shall be replenished, that they may know the glory of our Lord, as waters covering the sea. Woe to him that giveth drink to his friend, putting in his gall, and making drunk, that he may behold his nakedness. Thou art filled with ignominy for glory, drink thou also, and be fast a sleep: the cup of the right hand of our Lord shall compass thee, and the vomit of ignominy upon thy glory. Because the iniquity of Libanus shall cover thee, &amp; the wasting of the beasts shall terrify them for the bloods of men, and the iniquity of the land, and of the city, and of all that dwell therein. What profiteth the thing engraven, that the forger thereof hath graven it, a molten, and a false image? Because the forger thereof hath hoped in his forgery, to make dumb idols. Woe unto him that saith to wood: Awake: Arise, to the dumb stone. Why, can it teach? Behold, this same is covered with gold, and silver: and there is no spirit in the bowels thereof. But our Lord is in his holy temple: let all the earth be silent at his presence.</div>
