			<div class='roleText'>Thus saith our Lord: Heaven is my seat, and the earth my foot stool: what is this house that you will build to me? And what is this place of my rest? My hand hath made all these things, &amp; all these things have been done, saith our Lord. But to whom shall I have respect, but to the poor little one, &amp; the contrite of spirit, and him that trembleth at my words? He that immolateth an oxe, is as he that should slay a man: he that killeth a sheep in sacrifice, as he that should brain a dog: he that offereth oblation, as he that should offer swine's blood: he that remembereth frankincense, as he that should bless an idol. All these things have they chosen in their ways, and in their abominations their soul is delighted. Wherefore I also will choose their delusions: and the things that they feared, I will bring to them: because I called, and there was none that would answer: I have spoken, and they heard not: &amp; they have done evil in mine eyes, and have chosen the things that I would not. Hear the word of our Lord, ye that tremble at his word: your brethren that hate you, and reject you for my name sake, have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let the Lord be glorified, &amp; we shall see in your joy: but they shall be confounded. A voice of people from the city, a voice from the temple, the voice of our Lord repaying retribution to his enemies. Before she travailed, she brought forth, before her time came to be delivered, she brought forth a man child. Who ever heard such a thing? &amp; who hath seen the like to this? Why, shall the earth travail in one day? Or shall a nation be brought forth together, because Sion hath travailed, &amp; brought forth her children? Shall not I that make others to bring forth children, myself bring forth, saith the Lord? Shall I, that give generation to others, be barren, saith the Lord thy God? Rejoice with Jerusalem, &amp; be joyful in her all ye that love her: be glad with her in gladness all ye, that mourn upon her, that you may suck, &amp; be filled of the breast of her consolation: that you may milk, &amp; flow with delights in all manner of her glory. Because thus saith our Lord: Behold I will decline upon her as it were a flood of peace, and as a torrent overflowing the glory of the Gentiles, which you shall suck: at the breasts, you shall be carried, &amp; upon the knees they shall speak you fair. As if the mother would speak one fair, so will I comfort you, &amp; in Jerusalem you shall be comforted. You shall see, &amp; your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall spring as an herb, and the hand of our Lord shall be known to his servants, &amp; he shall be wrath with his enemies. Because lo our Lord will come in fire, &amp; his chariots as a whirlwind, to render his fury in indignation, &amp; his rebuking in flame of fire: because our Lord shall judge in fire, &amp; in his sword to all flesh, and the slain of our Lord shall be multiplied, they that were sanctified, &amp; thought themselves clean in the gardens behind the gate within, they that did eat swine's flesh, and abomination, and the mouse: they shall be confounded, saith our Lord. But I know their works, and their cogitations: I come that I may gather together, with all nations and tongues: and they shall come and shall see my glory. And I will put a sign in them, and I will send of them, that shall be saved, to the Gentiles into the sea, into Afrike, &amp; Lydia, them that hold the arrow: into Italy, and Greece; to the islands far off, to them that have not heard of me, and have not seen my glory. And they shall shew forth my glory to the Gentiles: and they shall bring all your brethren of all nations a gift to our Lord, upon horses, and in chariots, &amp; in horse-litters, &amp; on mules, and in coaches, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith our Lord, as if the children of Israel should bring in a gift in a clean vessel into the house of our Lord. And I will take of them to be Priests, &amp; Levites, saith our Lord. Because as new heavens, and a new earth, which I make to stand before me, saith our Lord: so shall your seed stand, and your name. And there shall be month after month, and sabbath after sabbath: all flesh shall come to adore before my face, saith our Lord. And they shall go out, and see the carcasses of the men, that have transgressed against me: their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched: and they shall be even unto satiety of sight to all flesh.</div>
