			<div class='roleText'>To Moab thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Woe upon Nabo, because it is wasted, and confounded: Cariathaim is taken: the strong one is confounded, and hath trembled. There is no more rejoicing in Moab: against Hesebon they have thought evil. Come, and let us destroy it from being a nation. Therefore shalt thou in silence hold thy peace, and the sword shall follow thee. The voice of a cry from Oronaim: waste, and great destruction. Moab is destroyed: proclaim a cry to her children. For by the ascent of Luith shall the mourner go up in weeping: because in the descent of Oronaim the enemies have heard the howling of destruction: Fly, save your lives: &amp; you shall be as heath in the desert. For that thou hast had confidence in thy munitions, and in thy treasures, thou also shalt be taken: and Chamos shall go into transmigration, his Priests, and his Princes together. And the spoiler shall come to every city, and no city shall be saved: and the valleys shall perish, &amp; the champion countries shall be destroyed: because our Lord hath said: Give ye the flower to Moab, because flourishing it shall go out: and her cities shall be desolate, and inhabitable. Cursed be he that doeth the work of our Lord fraudulently: and cursed that stayeth his sword from blood. Moab hath been fruitful from his youth, and hath rested in his dregs: neither hath he been poured out of vessel into vessel, and hath not gone into transmigration: therefore hath his taste remained in him, and his savour is not changed. Therefore behold the days come, saith our Lord: and I will send unto him those that shall order and dispose of his pots, and they shall overthrow him, and shall empty his vessels, and dash their pots one against another. And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of Israel was ashamed of Bethel, wherein it had confidence. How say ye: We are valiant, and strong men to fight? Moab is wasted, and her cities they have cast down: &amp; her chosen young men are gone down into slaughter: saith the King, the Lord of hosts is his name. The destruction of Moab is nigh to come: the evil thereof shall come exceeding swiftly. Comfort him all ye that are round about him, and all you that know his name, say: How is the strong rod broken, the glorious staff? Come down from thy glory, and sit in drought, o habitation of the daughter of Dibon: Because the waster of Moab shall come up to thee, he shall destroy thy munitions. Stand in the way, and look o habitation of Aroer: ask of him that flyeth: and say to him that hath escaped: What is chanced? Moab is confounded, because he is overcome: howl ye, and cry, declare in Arnon, that Moab is wasted. And judgement is come to the champion country: upon Helon, and upon Jasa, and upon Mephaath, and upon Dibon, and upon Nabo, &amp; upon the house of Deblathaim, and upon Cariathaim, and upon Bethgamul, and upon Bethmaon, and upon Carioth, and upon Bosra: and upon all the cities of the Land of Moab, that are far, and near. The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith our Lord. Make him drunken, because he is erected against our Lord: and Moab shall wring his hand in his vomiting, and himself also shall be in derision. For Israel hath been in derision unto thee: as though thou hadst found him amongst thieves: for thy words therefore, which thou hast spoken against him, thou shalt be led captive. Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock ye inhabitants of Moab, and be ye as a dove making her nest in the highest mouth of the hole. We have heard the pride of Moab, he is proud exceedingly: his haughtiness, and arrogancy, and pride, and loftiness of his heart. I know, saith our Lord, his boasting: and that the strength thereof is not according to it, neither hath it endeavoured to do according to that which it was able. Therefore will I wail upon Moab, and to all Moab will I cry, to the men of the earthen wall that lament. Of the mourning of Jazer I will weep to thee, o vineyard of Sabama: thy branches have passed over the sea, they are come even to the sea of Jaser: the spoiler hath violently entered upon thine harvest, and thy vintage. Joy and gladness is taken away out of Carmel, and out of the Land of Moab, and the wine out of the presses I have taken away: the treader of the grape shall not sing the accustomed cheerful note. From the cry of Hesebon unto Eleale, and Jasa, they have given their voice: from Segor to Oronaim, an heifer of three years old: the waters also of Nemrim shall be very ill. And I will take away from Moab, saith our Lord, him that offereth in the excelses, and that sacrificeth to his gods. Therefore shall my heart sound to Moab as a shalm: and my heart shall give the sound of shalms to the men of the earthen wall: because he hath done more than he could, therefore have they perished. For every head baldness, and every beard shall be shaven: in all hands binding together, &amp; upon every back cloth of hair. Upon all the house tops of Moab, &amp; in the streets thereof all mourning: because I have broken Moab as an unprofitable vessel, saith our Lord. How is it overcome, &amp; they have howled? How hath Moab cast down the neck, and is confounded? And Moab shall be in derision, and for an example to all round about him. Thus saith our Lord: Behold he shall fly as an eagle, and shall stretch forth his wings to Moab. Carioth is taken, and munitions are won: and the heart of the valiants of Moab in that day, shall be as the heart of a woman in travail. And Moab shall cease to be a people: because he hath gloried against our Lord. Fear, and pit, &amp; snare upon thee o inhabiter of Moab, saith our Lord. He that shall fly from the face of fear, shall fall into the pit: and he that shall come up out of the pit, shall be taken in the snare: for I will bring upon Moab the year of their visitation, saith our Lord. They stood in the shadow of Hesebon that fled from the snare: because there came a fire out of Hesebon, and a flame out of the midst of Sehon, and it hath devoured part of Moab, and the top of the children of tumult. Woe to thee Moab, thou hast perished, o people of Chamos: because thy sons are taken, and thy daughters into captivity. And I will convert the captivity of Moab in the last days, saith our Lord. Hitherto the judgements of Moab.</div>
