			<div class='roleText'>The Psalm of David. Our Lord ruleth me, and nothing shall be wanting to me: in place of pasture there he hath placed me. Upon the water of refection he hath brought me up: he hath converted my soul. He hath conducted me upon the paths of justice, for his name. For although I shall walk in the midst of the shadow of death, I will not fear evils: because thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff: they have comforted me. Thou hast prepared in my sight a table against them that trouble me. Thou hast fatted my head with oil: and my chalice inebriating how goodly is it! And thy mercy shall follow me all the days of my life. And that I may dwell in the house of our Lord, in longitude of days.</div>
