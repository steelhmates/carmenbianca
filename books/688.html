			<div class='roleText'>Emulate not evil men, neither desire thou to be with them: because their mind doth meditate robberies, and their lips speak deceits. By wisdom the house shall be built, and by prudence it shall be strengthened. In doctrine the cellars shall be replenished with all precious and most beautiful substance. A wiseman is strong: and a learned man, strong and valiant. Because war is managed by due ordering: &amp; there shall be salvation where many counsels are. Wisdom is high for a fool, in the gate he shall not open his mouth. He that thinketh to do evils, shall be called a fool. The cogitation of a fool is sin: and a detracter the abomination of men. If thou despair being weary in the day of distress: thy strength shall be diminished. Deliver them that are led to death: and those that are drawn to death cease not to deliver. If thou say, I am not of force: he that seeth into the heart, he understandeth, and nothing deceiveth the keeper of thy soul, and he shall render to man according to his works. Eat honey my son, because it is good, and the honey-comb most sweet to thy throat: so also the doctrine of wisdom to thy soul: which when thou shalt find, thou shalt have hope in the later end, and thy hope shall not perish. Lie not in wait, nor seek impiety in the house of the just, nor spoil his rest. For seven times shall the just fall, and shall rise again: but the impious shall fall into evil. When thine enemy shall fall, be not glad, and in his ruin let not thy heart rejoice: Lest perhaps our Lord see, and it displease him, and he take away his wrath from him. Contend not with the most wicked, nor emulate the impious: because evil men have not hope of things to come, and the lamp of the impious shall be extinguished. Fear our Lord, my son, and the king: &amp; with detracters meddle not: because their perdition shall suddenly rise; and the ruin of both who knoweth? These things also to the wise: to know a person in judgement is not good. They that say to the impious: Thou art just; peoples shall curse them, and tribes shall detest them. They that rebuke him, shall be praised: and blessing shall come upon them. He shall kiss the lips, who answereth right words. Prepare thy work abroad, and diligently till thy ground: that afterward thou mayst build thy house. Be not witness without cause against thy neighbour: neither allure any man with thy lips. Say not, As he hath done to me, so will I do to him: I will render to every one according to his work. I passed by the field of a slothful man, and by the vineyard of a foolish man: and behold nettles had filled it wholly, and thorns had covered the face thereof, and the wall of stones was destroyed. Which when I had seen, I laid it in my heart, and by the example I learned discipline. A little I say, thou shalt sleep, a little thou shalt slumber, a little shalt thou join thy hands together to rest: and as a post, poverty shall come to thee, &amp; beggary as a man armed.</div>
