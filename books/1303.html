			<div class='roleText'>BUT there were also false-prophets in the people, as also in you there shall be lying masters which shall bring in sects of perdition, and deny him that hath bought them, the Lord: bringing upon themselves speedy perdition. And many shall follow their riotousnesses, by whom the way of truth shall be blasphemed. And in avarice shall they with feigned words make merchandise of you. Unto whom the judgement now long since ceaseth not: and their perdition slumbereth not. For if God spared not Angels sinning: but with the ropes of Hell being drawn down into Hell delivered them to be tormented, that they should be reserved unto judgement: and he spared not the original world, but kept the eight, Noe, the preacher of justice, bringing in the deluge upon the world of the impious. And bringing the cities of the Sodomites &amp; of the Gomorrheites into ashes, he damned them with subversion, putting an example of them that shall do impiously: and delivered just Lot oppressed by the injury and luxurious conversation of the abominable men. For in sight and hearing he was just: dwelling with them who from day to day vexed the just soul with unjust works. Our Lord knoweth to deliver the godly from tentation, but to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgement to be tormented: and especially them which walk after the flesh in concupiscence of uncleanness, and contemn dominion, bold, self-pleasers: they fear not to bring in sects, blaspheming. Whereas Angels being greater in strength and power, bear not the execrable judgement against them. But these men as unreasonable beasts, naturally tending to the snare and into destruction, in those things which they know not, blaspheming, shall perish in their corruption, receiving the reward of injustice, esteeming for a pleasure the delights of a day: coinquinations and spots, flowing in delicacies, in their feastings rioting with you, having eyes full of adultery and incessant sin: alluring unstable souls, having their heart exercised with avarice, the children of malediction: leaving the right way they have erred, having followed the way of Balaam of Bosor, which loved the reward of iniquity, but had a check of his madness, the dumb beast under the yoke, speaking with man's voice, prohibited the foolishness of the prophet. These are fountains without water, and clouds, tossed with whirl-winds, to whom the mist of darkness is reserved. For, speaking the proud things of vanity, they allure in the desires of fleshly riotousness, those that escape a little, which converse in error, promising them liberty, whereas themselves are the slaves of corruption. For wherewith a man is overcome, of that he is the slave also. For if flying from the coinquinations of the world in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour JESUS Christ, they again entangled with the same be overcome: the later things are become unto them worse than the former. For it was better for them not to know the way of justice, than after the knowledge, to turn back from that holy commandment which was delivered to them. For, that of the true proverb is chanced to them, The dog returned to his vomit: and, The sow washed^ into her wallowing in the mire.</div>
