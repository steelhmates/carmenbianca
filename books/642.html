			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. Often have they impugned me from my youth, let Israel now say: Often have they impugned me from my youth: but they have not prevailed against me. Sinners have builded upon my back: they have prolonged their iniquity. Our just Lord will cut the necks of sinners: let them all be confounded and turned backward, that hate Sion. Let them be made as grass in the tops of houses: which is withered before it be plucked up. Whereof the reaper hath not filled his hand, and he that gathereth the sheaves his bosom. And they said not that passed by: The blessing of our Lord be upon you: we have blessed you in the name of our Lord.</div>
