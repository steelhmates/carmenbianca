			<div class='roleText'>And when Salomon had finished to pour out his prayers, fire descended from heaven, and devoured the holocausts &amp; victims: and the majesty of our Lord filled the house. Neither could the Priests enter into the Temple of our Lord, because the majesty of our Lord had filled the temple of our Lord. Yea and all the children of Israel saw the fire descending, and the glory of our Lord upon the house: and falling flat on the earth upon the pavement paved with stone, they adored, and praised our Lord: Because he is good, because his mercy is for ever. And the king and all the people immolated victims before our Lord. King Salomon therefore killed hosts, of oxen twenty two thousand, of rams an hundred twenty thousand: and the king and all the people dedicated the house of God. And the Priests stood in their offices: and the Levites with the instruments of the songs of our Lord, which David the king made to praise our Lord: Because his mercy is for ever, singing the hymns of David by their hands: moreover the Priests sounded with trumpets before them, and all Israel stood. Salomon also sanctified the midst of the court before the temple of our Lord: for he had offered there the holocausts, &amp; the fat of the pacifics: because the brazen altar, which he had made, could not sustain the holocausts and the sacrifices and the fat. Salomon therefore made a solemnity at that time seven days, and all Israel with him, an assembly very great, from the entrance of Emath to the Torrent of Aegypt. And he made in the eighth day an assembly, because he had dedicated the altar seven days, and had celebrated the solemnity seven days. Therefore in the three and twentieth day of the seventh month, he dismist the people to their tabernacles, rejoicing and being glad for the good, that our Lord had done to David, and Salomon, and Israel his people. And Salomon accomplished the house of our Lord, and the house of the king, and all that he had disposed in his heart to do, in the house of our Lord, and in his own house, and he prospered. And our Lord appeared to him by night, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to me for a house of sacrifice. If I shall shut heaven, and rain fall not, and shall bid and command the locust to devour the land, and shall send pestilence into my people: and my people being converted upon whom my name is invocated, shall beseech me, and seek out my face, and shall do penance from their most wicked ways: I also will hear from heaven, and will be propitious to their sins, and will save their land. Mine eyes also shall be opened, and mine ears erected to his prayer, that shall pray in this place. For I have chosen, and have sanctified this place, that my name may be there for ever, and mine eyes and my heart may remain there all days. Thou also if thou walk before me, as David thy father walked, &amp; shalt do according to all things, which I have commanded thee, and shalt keep my justices and judgments: I will raise up the throne of thy Kingdom, as I promised to David thy father, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>There shall not be taken away of thy stock a man, that shall be Prince in Israel. But if you shall be turned away, and shall forsake my justices, and my precepts, which I have proposed to you, and going shall serve strange gods, and adore them, I will pluck you out of my land, which I have given you: and this house, which I have sanctified to my name, I will cast away from my face, and will deliver it for a parable, and an example to all peoples. And this house shall be for a proverb to all passengers, and they shall say being astonished: Why hath the Lord done so to this land, and to this house? And they shall answer: Because they forsook the Lord the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the Land of Aegypt, and took hold of strange gods, and adored them, and worshipped them: therefore are all these evils come upon them.</div>
