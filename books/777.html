			<div class='roleText'>The firmament of height is his beauty, the beauty of heaven is in the vision of glory. The sun in sight declaring at his coming forth, a marvelous instrument, the work of the Highest. At noon it burneth the earth, and who can abide in the presence of the heat thereof: keeping a furnace in the works of heat: the sun three times so much burning the mountains, casting out fiery beams, and shining with his beams blindeth the eyes. Great is our Lord that made it, and by his words it hath hastened his course. And the moon in all in her time, is the shewing of season and the sign of age. By the moon is the sign of a festival day, a light that diminisheth in consummation. The month is according to her name, increasing marvelously in consummation. An instrument of the camp on high, shining gloriously in the firmament of heaven. The glory of the stars is the beauty of heaven, our Lord illuminating the world on high. In the words of the holy one they shall stand to judgement, and shall not fail in their watches. See the bow, and bless him that made it: it is very beautiful in his brightness. It hath compassed heaven in the circuit of his glory, the hands of the Highest have opened it. But by his commandment he hath hastened snow, &amp; he hasteth to send forth the lightnings of his judgement. Therefore are the treasures opened, &amp; the clouds fly forth as birds. By his greatness he hath set the clouds, &amp; the hailstones are broken. In his sight the mountains shall be moved, &amp; at his will the south wind hath blown. The noise of his thunder shall beat the earth, the tempest of the northwind, and the gathering together of wind: and as the bird lighting down to sit, he scattereth snow, and the falling thereof, is as the locust diving downward. The eye shall admire the beauty of the whiteness thereof, and the heart quaketh at the shower thereof. He shall pour out frost upon the earth as salt: and when it freezeth, it shall be made as the tops of a thistle. The cold north wind blew, &amp; of water there froze crystal, upon all gathering together of waters it shall rest, &amp; as a breast plate it shall put itself upon the waters. And it shall devour the mountains, &amp; burn the desert, &amp; extinguish that which is green as fire. The remedy of all is in the hasty coming of a cloud, and a dew meeting it by the heat that cometh, shall make it quail. At his word the wind was still, and with his thought he appeased the depth, and our Lord planted Islands therein. They that sail on the sea, tell the perils thereof: &amp; hearing with our ears we shall marvel. There are goodly works, &amp; marvelous: diverse kinds of beasts, &amp; of all cattle, &amp; the creature of mighty beasts. Through him is the end of their journey confirmed, and by his word all things are set in order. We shall say many things, &amp; shall fail in words; but the sum of our words is, He is in all. Glorifying him how far shall we be able? For the omnipotent himself is above all his works. Our Lord is terrible, &amp; exceeding great, &amp; his might is marvelous. Glorifying our Lord as much as ever you can, he shall yet surpass, and his magnificence is marvelous. Blessing our Lord, exalt him as much as you can: for he is greater than all praise. Exalting him be ye replenished with strength. Labour not: for you shall not comprehend. Who shall see him, and shall declare him? And who shall magnify him as he is from the beginning? Many things hid are greater than these: for we have seen few of his works. But our Lord made all things, and to them that live piously he hath given wisdom.</div>
