			<div class='roleText'>But Job answering, said: Now also my talk is in bitterness, and the hand of my plague is aggravated upon my mourning. Who will grant me that I may know and find him, &amp; come even to his throne? I will set judgement before him, and will fill my mouth with accusations. That I may know the words that he will answer me, and understand what he will speak to me. I will not that he contend with me with much strength, nor that he oppress me with the weight of his greatness. Let him propose equity against me, and my judgment shall come to victory. If I shall go to the East, he appeareth not: if to the West, I shall not understand him. If to the left hand, what shall I do? I shall not apprehend him: if I turn myself to the right hand, I shall not see him. But he knoweth my way, and hath proved me as gold that passeth through the fire: My foot hath followed his steps, I have kept his way, &amp; have not declined out of it. From the commandments of his lips I have not departed, and I have hid the words of his mouth in my bosom. For he is alone, and no man can turn away his cogitation: and whatsoever his soul would, that hath he done. And when he shall have fulfilled his will in me, many other things also are at hand with him. And therefore I am troubled at his face, and considering him I am made pensive with fear. God hath mollified my heart, and the Omnipotent hath troubled me. For I have not perished because of the imminent darkness, neither hath the mist covered my face.</div>
