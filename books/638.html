			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. They that trust in our Lord, as mount Sion: he shall not be moved for ever that dwelleth in Jerusalem. Mountains round about it: and our Lord round about his people, from hence forth now and for ever. Because our Lord will not leave the rod of sinners upon the lot of the just: that the just reach not their hands to iniquity. Do well, o Lord, to the good, and right of heart. But those that decline into obligations, our Lord will bring with them that work iniquity: peace upon Israel.</div>
