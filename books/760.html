			<div class='roleText'>The husband of a good wife is happy: for the number of his years is double. A strong woman delighteth her husband, and shall accomplish the years of his life in peace. A good woman is a good portion, in the good portion of them that fear God shall she be given to a man for good deeds: And the heart of rich and poor is good, at all time their countenance is merry. Of three things my heart hath been afraid, and at the fourth my face hath trembled: The betraying of a city, and a gathering together of the people: false calumny, all more grievous than death. A jealous woman is the sorrow and mourning of the heart. In a jealous woman is a scourge of the tongue, communicating with all. As a yoke of oxen that is moved, so also a wicked woman: he that holdeth her, is as he that taketh hold of a scorpion. A woman given to drunkenness is great anger: &amp; her contumely and turpitude shall not be hid. The fornication of a woman shall be known in the lifting up of her eyes, and in her eye-lids. On thy daughter that turneth not away herself, set sure watch: lest occasion found she abuse herself. Take heed of the impudency of her eyes, and marvel not if she contemn thee. As a wayfaring man that thirsteth, will she open her mouth to the fountain, and will drink of every water that is next, &amp; will sit against every hedge, and open her quiver against every arrow, until she fail. The grace of a diligent woman shall delight her husband, and shall fat his bones. Her discipline is the gift of God. A wise and still woman, there is no exchange for a soul instructed. A holy, and shamefast woman, is grace upon grace. And all weight is not worthy a continent soul. As the sun rising to the world in the highest places of God, so is the beauty of a good woman for an ornament of her house. A lamp shining upon the holy candlestick, &amp; the beauty of the face upon stayed age. Pillars of gold upon feet of silver, and stable feet upon the soles of a stayed woman. Eternal foundations upon a sound rock, and the commandments of God in the heart of a holy woman. At two things my heart is grieved, and at the third anger is come upon me: A man of war decaying by poverty: and a wise man contemned: and he that transgresseth from justice to sin, God hath prepared him to the sword. Two sorts have appeared unto me hard and dangerous, a merchant is hardly rid of negligence: and a viteler shall not be justified from the sins of the lips.</div>
