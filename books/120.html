And these be the names of the sons of Aaron: his first begotten Nadab, then Abiu, and Eleazar, and Ithamar. These are the names of the sons of Aaron the Priests that were anointed, and whose hands were filled and consecrated, to do the function of the priesthood. For Nadab and Abiu died, when they offered the strange fire in the sight of our Lord, in the desert of Sinai, without children: and Eleazar and Ithamar did the function of priesthood in the presence of Aaron their father. And our Lord spake to Moyses, saying: </div>

The sons of Caath: Amram, and Iesaar, Hebron &amp; Oziel. The sons of Merari: Moholi &amp; Musi. Of Gerson were two families, the Lebnitical, &amp; Semeitical: of whom were numbered the people of male sex from one month &amp; upward, seven thousand five hundred. These shall pitch behind the tabernacle on the West, under their Prince Heliasaph, the son of Lael. And their charge shall be in the tabernacle of covenant, the tabernacle it-self and the cover thereof, the hanging that is drawn before the doors of the roof of covenant, and the curtains of the court: the hanging also that is hanged in the entry of the court of the tabernacle, and whatsoever pertaineth to the rite of the altar, the cords of the tabernacle, and all the furniture thereof. The kindred of Caath shall have the peoples of the Amramites, and Iesaarites, and Hebronites, and Ozielites. These are the families of the Caathites reckoned by their names: all of the male sex from one month and upward, eight thousand six hundred, they shall have the guard of the Sanctuary, and shall camp on the south side. And their Prince shall be Elizaphan the son of Oziel: and they shall keep the ark, and table, and the candlestick, the altars, and the vessels of the Sanctuary, wherein the ministration is, and the veil, and all such kind of implements. And the Prince of the Princes of the Levites, Eliazar, the son of Aaron the Priest, shall be over them that watch for the custody of the Sanctuary. But of Merari shall be the peoples of the Moholites, and Musites, reckoned by their names: all of the male kind from one month &amp; upward, six thousand two hundred. There Prince Suriel the son of Abihaiel: they shall camp on the north side. Under their custody shall be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars, and the pillars and their feet, and all things that pertain to this kind of service: and the pillars of the court round about with their feet, and the pins with the cords. Before the tabernacle of covenant, that is to say, on the east side, shall Moyses and Aaron camp, with their sons, having the custody of the Sanctuary, in the midst of the children of Israel. What stranger soever cometh thereto, shall die. All the Levites, that Moyses and Aaron numbered, according to the precept of our Lord by their families in the male kind from one month and upward, were twenty two thousand. And our Lord said to Moyses: </div>
