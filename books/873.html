			<div class='roleText'>Thus saith our Lord: Go down into the house of the king of Juda, and there thou shalt speak this word, and shalt say: Hear the word of our Lord, o king of Juda, which sittest upon the throne of David: thou &amp; thy servants, and thy people, which enter in by these gates. Thus saith our Lord: Do ye judgement &amp; justice, &amp; deliver the oppressed by violence out of the hand of the oppressor: and the stranger, and pupil, and widow make not sorrowful, nor oppress them unjustly: and the innocent blood^ shed not in this place. For if doing you will do this thing, there shall enter in by the gates of this house, kings of the stock of David sitting upon his throne, and mounting upon chariots and horses, they and their servants, and their people. But if you will not hear these words: by myself I have sworn, saith our Lord, that this house shall be into desolation. Because thus saith our Lord upon the house of the king of Juda: Galaad thou art unto me the head of Libanus: if I make thee not a wilderness, cities not habitable. And I will sanctify upon thee a killing man and his weapons: and they shall cut down thy chosen cedars, and shall cast them headlong into the fire. And many nations shall pass by this city: and every one shall say to his neighbour: Why hath the Lord done so to this great city? And they shall answer: Because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God, and have adored strange gods, and served them. Weep not for the dead, neither mourn ye upon him with weeping: Lament him that goeth forth, because he shall return no more, nor see the land of his nativity. Because thus saith our lord to Sellum the son of Josias the king of Juda, who hath reigned for Josias his father, who is gone forth out of this place. He shall return hither no more: but in the place, to which I have transported him, there shall he die, and he shall not see this land any more. Woe to him that buildeth his house in injustice, and his chambers not in judgement: his friend he will oppress without cause, and his hire he will not render him. Who saith: I will build me a broad house, and large chambers; who openeth to himself windows, and maketh embowed ceilings of cedar, and painteth them with ruddle. Why, shalt thou reign, because thou comparest thyself to the cedar? Why, did not thy father eat and drink, &amp; do judgement &amp; justice then when it was well with him? He judged the cause of the poor &amp; needy to his own good, did he it not therefore because he knew me, saith our Lord? But thine eyes and heart are to avarice, and to shed innocent blood, and to crafty oppression, &amp; to the course of evil work. Therefore thus saith our Lord to Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda: They shall not mourn for him, Alas brother, &amp; alas sister: they shall not cry together to him, Alas Lord, and alas o noble one. With the burial of an ass shall he be buried, rotted and cast forth without the gates of Jerusalem. Go up to Libanus and cry: and in Basan give thy voice, &amp; cry to them that pass by, because all thy lovers are destroyed. I spake to thee in thine aboundance: &amp; thou saidst: I will not hear: This is thy way from thy youth, because thou heardest not my voice. The wind shall feed all thy Pastors, &amp; thy lovers shall go into captivity: &amp; then shalt thou be confounded, and ashamed of all thy malice. Thou that sittest in Libanus, and makest thy nest in the cedars, how hast thou mourned together when sorrows came to thee, as the sorrows of a woman in travail? I live, saith our Lord: that if Jechonias the son of Joakim the king of Juda shall be a ring on my right hand, thence will I pluck him off. And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them, whose face thou fearest, and into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldees. And I will send thee, and thy mother that bare thee, into a strange country, in the which you were not born, &amp; there you shall die: and into the land, whereto they lift up their mind to return thither: they shall not return. Why, is this man Jechonias an earthen and broken vessel? Is he a vessel without all pleasure? Why are they cast away, he and his seed are cast forth into a land which they know not? Earth, earth, earth, hear the word of our Lord. Thus saith our Lord: Write this man barren, a man that in his days shall not prosper: for neither shall there be a man of his seed, that shall sit upon the throne of David, and have power any more in Juda.</div>
