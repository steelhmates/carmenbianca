			<div class='roleText'>These also are the parables of Salomon, which the men of Ezechias king of Juda wrote out. It is the glory of God to conceal the word, and the glory of kings to search the speech. The heaven above, and the earth beneath, and the heart of kings is unscrutable. Take away the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most pure vessel: Take away impiety from the king's countenance, and his throne shall be established with justice. Appear not glorious before the king, and in the place of great men stand not. For it is better that it be said to thee: Come up hither, than that thou be humbled before the Prince. The things which thy eyes have seen, utter not quickly in a brawl: lest afterward thou canst not amend it, when thou hast dishonoured thy friend. Treat thy cause with thy friend, and reveal not a secret to a stranger: lest perhaps he insult against thee when he heareth, and cease not to upbraid thee. Grace and friendship deliver: which keep to thyself, lest thou become reproachful. Apples of gold in silver beds, he that speaketh a word in his time. A golden earlet, and a shining precious stone, he that rebuketh a wiseman, and an obedient ear. As the cold of snow in the day of harvest, so a faithful legate to him that sent him, maketh his soul to rest. Clouds, and wind, and no rain following, a glorious man, and not accomplishing his promises. By patience the Prince shall be pacified, and a soft tongue shall break hardness. Thou hast found honey, eat that which sufficeth thee, lest perhaps being filled thou vomit it up. Withdraw thy foot from the house of thy neighbour, lest sometime having his fill he hate thee. A dart, and sword, and a sharp arrow, a man that speaketh false testimony against his neighbour. A rotten tooth, and weary foot, he that hopeth upon the unfaithful in the day of distress, and that loseth his cloak in the day of cold. Vinegar in nitre, he that singeth songs to a naughty heart. As a moth the garment, and a worm the wood: so the sadness of a man hurteth the heart. If thine enemy shall hunger, give him meat: if he thirst, give him water to drink: for thou shalt heap hot coals upon his head, and our Lord will reward thee. The north-wind dissipateth rains, &amp; a sad look the tongue that detracteth. It is better to sit in a corner of the house top, than with a brawling woman, and in a common house. Cold water to a thirsty soul, and good tidings from a far country. A fountain troubled with the foot, and a vein corrupted, the just falling before the impious. As he that eateth much honey, it is not good for him: so he that is a searcher of the majesty, shall be oppressed of the glory. As a city being open and without compass of walls, so a man that cannot repress his spirit in speaking.</div>
