			<div class='roleText'>The queen of Saba also, when she had heard the fame of Salomon, came to prove him in hard propositions in Jerusalem, with great riches, and camels, which carried spices, and very much gold, and precious stones. And when she was come to Salomon, she spake to him what things soever were in her heart. And Salomon expounded to her all things that she propounded: neither was there any thing, that he made not plain unto her. Who after she saw, to wit, the wisdom of Salomon, and the house which he had built, moreover also the meats of his table, and the habitations of his servants, and the offices of his ministers, and their garments, the cup-bearers also, and their garments, and the victims, which he immolated in the house of our Lord: there was no spirit in her any longer, she was so astonished. And she said to the king: The word is true, which I heard in my country of thy virtues and wisdom. I did not believe them that told it, until myself was come, and mine eyes had seen, and I had proved scarce the half part of thy wisdom to have been told me: thou hast passed the fame with thy virtues. Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants, which assist before thee at all time, and hear thy wisdom. Be the Lord thy God blessed, who would ordain thee over his throne, king of the Lord thy God. Because God loveth Israel, &amp; will preserve it for ever: therefore hath he set thee king over it, to do judgments and justice. And she gave to the king an hundred twenty talents of gold, and spices exceeding much, and most precious stones: there were not such spices, as these, which the queen of Saba gave to king Salomon. But the servants of Hiram also with the servants of Salomon brought gold from Ophir, &amp; Thym-trees, &amp; most precious stones: whereof the king made, to wit, of the Thym-trees, stairs in the house of our Lord, and in the king's house, harps also and psalteries for the singing men: never were there seen such trees in the Land of Juda. And king Salomon gave to the queen of Saba all things that she would, and that she asked, and many more things than she brought to him: who returning, went into her country with her servants. And the weight of the gold, that was brought to Salomon every year was six hundred sixty six talents of gold: beside that sum, which the legates of diverse nations, and the merchants were accustomed to bring, and all the kings of Arabia, and the Dukes of the lands, which brought gold and silver to Salomon. King Salomon therefore made two hundred golden spears, of the sum of six hundred pieces of gold, which were spent in every spear: also three hundred golden shields of three hundred pieces of gold, with which every shield was covered: and the king put them in the armoury, which was beset with a wood. The king also made a great throne of ivory, and covered it with most fine gold. six steps also, wherewith the going up was to the throne, and a foot-stool of gold, and two little arms on either side, and two lions standing by the little arms, yea and other twelve little lions standing upon the steps on both sides: there was not such a throne in all kingdoms. All the vessels also of the king's table were of gold, and the vessels of the house of the forest of Libanus of most pure gold. For silver in those days was reputed for nothing. For the king's ships went into Tharsis with the servants of Hiram, once in three years: and they brought from thence gold and silver, and ivory, and apes, and peacocks. Salomon therefore was magnified above all the kings of the earth for riches and glory. And all the kings of the earth desired to see Salomon's face, that they might hear the wisdom, which God had given in his heart. And they brought him gifts, vessels of silver, and gold, and garments, and armour, and spices, horses, and mules, every year. Salomon also had forty thousand horses in the stables, and of chariots, and horsemen twelve thousand, and he placed them in the cities of the chariots, and where the king was in Jerusalem. He exercised also authority over all the kings from the river Euphrates unto the land of the Philisthians, and unto the borders of Aegypt. And he made so great plenty of silver in Jerusalem as it were of stones: and of cedars so great a multitude as of sycamores, which grow in the champion. And horses were brought him out of Aegypt, &amp; all countries. But the rest of the works of Salomon the first and the last are written in the words of Nathan the Prophet, and in the Books of Ahias the Silonite, in the Vision also of Addo the Seer, against Jeroboam the son of Nabat. And Salomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years. And he slept with his fathers: and they buried him in the city of David: and Roboam his son reigned for him.</div>
