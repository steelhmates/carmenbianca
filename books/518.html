			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end in songs, the Psalm of David. When I invocated, the God of my justice heard me: in tribulation thou hast enlarged to me. Have mercy on me, and hear my prayer. Ye sons of men how long are you of heavy heart? Why love you vanity, and seek lying? And know ye that our Lord hath made his holy one marvelous: our Lord will hear me, when I shall cry to him. Be ye angry, and sin not: the things that you say in your hearts, in your chambers be ye sorry for. Sacrifice ye the sacrifice of justice, and hope in our Lord. Many say: Who sheweth us good things? The light of thy countenance, o Lord is signed upon us: thou hast given gladness in my heart. By the fruit of their corn, and wine, and oil, they are multiplied. In peace in the self same I will sleep, and rest: Because thou Lord hast singularly settled me in hope.</div>
