			<div class='roleText'>AND he spake also a parable to them that it behoveth always to pray, &amp; not to be weary, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>There was a certain judge in a certain city, which feared not God, and of man made no account. And there was a certain widow in that city, and she came to him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Revenge me of mine adversary. And he would not of a long time. But afterward he said within himself: Although I fear not God, nor make account of man, yet because this widow is importune upon me, I will revenge her, lest at the last she come and defame me. And our Lord said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hear what the judge of iniquity sayeth. And will not God revenge his elect that cry to him day and night: and will he have patience in them? I say to you that he will quickly revenge them. But yet the Son of man coming, shall he find trow you, faith in the earth? And he said also to certain that trusted in themselves as just, and despised others, this parable: Two men went up into the Temple to pray: the one a Pharisee, and the other a Publican. The Pharisee standing, prayed thus with himself: God, I give thee thanks that I am not as the rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, as also this Publican. I fast twice in a week: I give tithes of all that I possess. And the Publican standing a far off would not so much as lift up his eyes toward Heaven; but he knocked his breast, saying: </div>

I say to you, this man went down into his house justified more than he: because every one that exalteth himself, shall be humbled; and he that humbleth himself, shall be exalted. And they brought unto him infants also, that he might touch them. Which thing when the Disciples saw, they rebuked them. But JESUS calling them together, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Good Master, by doing what, shall I possess everlasting life? And JESUS said to him: Why doest thou call me good? None is good but only God.

Which JESUS hearing, said to him: Yet one thing thou lackest: Sell all that ever thou hast, &amp; give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven: and come follow me. He hearing these things, was stroken sad: because he was very rich. And JESUS seeing him stroken sad, said: </div>

Who said to them: Amen I say to you, there is no man that hath left house, or parents, or brethren, or wife, or children for the Kingdom of God, and shall not receive much more in this time, and in the world to come life everlasting. And JESUS took the Twelve, and said to them: Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be consummate which were written by the Prophets^ of the Son of man. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and shall be mocked, and scourged, and spit upon: and after they have scourged him, they will kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they understood none of these things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood not the things that were said. And it came to pass, when he drew nigh to Jericho, a certain blind man sat by the way, begging. And when he heard the multitude passing by, he asked what this should be. And they told him that JESUS of Nazareth passed by. And he cried saying: </div>
