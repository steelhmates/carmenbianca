			<div class='roleText'>Nabuchodonosor the king made a statua of gold in height of sixty cubits, in breadth of six cubits, and he set it in the field of Dura of the province of Babylon. Therefore Nabuchodonosor the king sent to call together the nobles, the magistrates, and judges, dukes, and tyrants, and rulers, and all the princes of the countries, that they should come together to the dedication of the statua, which Nabuchodonosor the king had erected. Then were the nobles gathered together, the magistrates, and judges, the dukes, and tyrants, &amp; the great men that were placed in regiments, and all the princes of the countries, to come together to the dedication of the statua, which Nabuchodonosor the king had erected. And they stood in the sight of the statua, which Nabuchodonosor the king had set up. And the crier cried mightily: To you peoples, and tribes, and tongues it is said: In the hour that you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, &amp; pipe, and harp, of the dulcimer, and psalter, and symphony, &amp; all kind of musical instruments: falling adore ye the golden statua, which Nabuchodonosor the king hath set up. But if any man shall not adore prostrate, he shall the self same hour be cast into a furnace of burning fire. After this therefore forthwith as all the peoples heard the sound of the trumpet, the pipe, &amp; harp, of the dulcimer, and psalter, of the symphony, and of all kind of musical instruments: all the peoples, tribes, and tongues falling adored the golden statua, which Nabuchodonosor the king had set up. And forthwith in the very same time men of Chaldee coming accused the Jews, and said to Nabuchodonosor the king: King for ever live: thou, o king hast made a decree, that every man which shall hear the sound of the trumpet, of the pipe, and harp, of the dulcimer, and psalter, of the symphony, and of all kind of musical instruments, prostrate himself, and adore the golden statua: and if any man do not prostrate on the ground adore, that he be cast into a furnace of burning fire. There are therefore men of Jewry, whom thou didst appoint over the works of the country of Babylon, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago: these men, o king, have contemned thy decree: thy gods they worship not, and the golden statua, which thou hast erected, they adore not. Then Nabuchodonosor in fury, and in wrath commanded, that Sidrach, Misach, &amp; Abdenago should be brought: who immediately were brought before the king. And Nabuchodonosor the king pronouncing, said to them: Indeed Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, do not you worship my gods, &amp; the golden statua that I have set up do not you adore? Now therefore if you be ready, in what hour soever you shall hear the sound of the trumpet, the pipe, the harp, of the dulcimer, and psalter, and symphony, and of all kind of musical instruments, prostrate yourselves, &amp; adore the statua which I have made: but if you adore not, the self same hour you shall be cast into the furnace of burning fire: and what God is there that shall deliver you out of my hand? Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago answering said to king Nabuchodonosor: We must not answer thee concerning this thing. For behold our God, whom we worship, can save us from the furnace of burning fire, and out of thy hands, o king, deliver us. But if he will not, be it known to thee, o king, that we worship not thy gods, &amp; the golden statua, which thou hast erected, we adore not. Then was Nabuchodonosor replenished with fury: and the look of his face was altered upon Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and he commanded that the furnace should be heated seven times more, than it had been accustomed to be heated. And commanded the strongest men of his host, to bind the feet of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, and to cast them into the furnace of burning fire. And forthwith those men being bound with their breeches, and head attire, and shoes, and garments were cast into the furnace of burning fire. For the commandment of the king did urge, and the furnace was heated exceedingly. Moreover the flame of the fire slew those men, that had cast in Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago. But these three men, that is, Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago fell in the midst of the furnace of burning fire, bound together. And they walked in the midst of the flame praising God, and blessing our Lord. And Azarias standing prayed thus, and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire, he said: Blessed art thou o Lord the God of our fathers, and laudable, and glorious is thy name for ever: because thou art just in all things, which thou hast done to us, and all thy works are true, and thy ways right, and all thy judgements true. For thou hast done true judgements according to all things, that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers Jerusalem: because in truth, &amp; in judgement thou hast brought in all these things for our sins. For we have sinned, and done unjustly revolting from thee: and we have offended in all things; and thy precepts we have not heard, nor observed, nor done as thou hadst commanded us, that it might be well with us. All things therefore that thou hast brought in upon us, and all things that thou hast done to us, thou hast done with true judgement: and thou hast delivered us into the hands of our enemies unjust, &amp; most wicked, &amp; prevaricators, &amp; to an unjust king and most wicked above all the earth. And now we cannot open the mouth: we are become a confusion, and reproach to thy servants, &amp; to them that worship thee. Deliver us not for ever, we beseech thee, for thy name sake, and dissipate not thy testament: neither take thou away thy mercy from us, for Abraham thy beloved, and Isaac thy servant, and Israel thy holy one: to whom thou hast spoken, promising that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is in the sea shore. Because o Lord we are diminished more than all nations, and are abased in all the earth this day for our sins. And there is not at this time prince, &amp; duke, and prophet, nor holocaust, nor sacrifice, nor oblation, nor incense, nor place of first fruits before thee, that we may find thy mercy: but in contrite mind, &amp; spirit of humility let us be received. As in holocaust of rams, and bulls, and as in thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be made in thy sight this day, that it may please thee: because there is no confusion to them that trust in thee. And now we follow thee in all our heart, and fear thee, and seek thy face. Confound us not, but do with us according to thy meekness, and according to the multitude of thy mercy. And deliver us in thy marvels, and give glory to thy name o Lord: and let all be confounded that shew evils to thy servants, let them be confounded in all thy might, and let their strength be broken: and let them know that thou art the Lord, the only God, and glorious over the round world. And the king's servants that had cast them in, ceased not to heat the furnace, with Naphtha, and tow, and pitch, and dry sticks, and the flame mounted out above the furnace nine and forty cubits: and it brake forth, and burnt them whom it found by the furnace, of the Chaldees. But the Angel of our Lord descended with Azarias, and his fellows into the furnace: and he shook the flame of the fire out of the furnace, and made the midst of the furnace as a wind of dew blowing, and the fire touched them not at all, nor pained them, nor did them any grievance. Then these three as out of one mouth praised, and glorified, and blessed God in the furnace, saying: Blessed art thou o Lord the God of our fathers: and laudable, and glorious, and superexalted for ever: and blessed is the holy name of thy glory: and laudable, and superexalted in all ages. Blessed art thou in the holy temple of thy glory: &amp; passing laudable, and passing glorious for ever. Blessed art thou in the throne of thy kingdom, and passing laudable, and superexalted for ever. Blessed art thou, that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the Cherubs: and laudable, and superexalted for ever. Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and laudable and glorious for ever. All works of our Lord bless ye our Lord, praise and superexalt him for ever. Bless our Lord ye Angels of our Lord: praise and superexalt him for ever.

Confess ye to our Lord, because he is good: because his mercy is for ever. All religious bless ye our Lord the God of gods: praise and confess ye to him, because his mercy is unto all worlds. Then Nabuchodonosor the king was astonished, and he arose hastily, &amp; said to his nobles: Did we not cast three men fettered into the midst of the fire? Who answering the king, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Behold I see four men loose, and walking in the midst of the fire, and there is no corruption in them, &amp; the form of the fourth is like to the son of God. Then came Nabuchodonosor to the door of the furnace of burning fire, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Sidrach, Misach, &amp; Abdenago, servants of the high God, go ye forth, and come. And forthwith Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago went out of the midst of the fire. And the nobles, and the magistrates, and judges, and the potentates of the king being gathered together, beheld those men, that the fire had no power on their bodies, &amp; not a hair of their head was singed, yea their breeches were not altered, &amp; the scent of the fire had not passed by them. And Nabuchodonosor breaking forth, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Blessed be the God of them, to wit, of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, who hath sent his Angel, and hath delivered his servants that believed in him: and they changed the king's word, &amp; delivered their bodies that they might not serve, and might not adore any god, except their own God. By me therefore this decree is made, that every people, tribe, and tongue, whatsoever shall speak blasphemy against the God of Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago, he perish, and his house be wasted: for there is none other God, that can so save. Then did the king promote Sidrach, Misach, and Abdenago in the province of Babylon. Nabuchodonosor the king, to all peoples, nations, and tongues, that dwell in the whole earth, peace be multiplied unto you. The high God hath wrought signs and marvelous things with me. It hath pleased me therefore to publish his signs, because they are great: and his marvels, because they are strong: and his kingdom an everlasting kingdom, &amp; his power in generation and to generation.</div>
