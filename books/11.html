			<div class='roleText'>And the earth was of one tongue, and all one speech. And when they removed from the east, they found a plain in the land of Sennaar, and dwelt in it. And each one said to his neighbour: Come, let us make brick, and bake them with fire. And they had brick instead of stone, and bitume instead of mortar: and they said, Come, let us make us a city and a tower, the top whereof may reach to heaven: and let us renown our name before we be dispersed into all lands. And our Lord descended to see the city and the tower, which the children of Adam builded, and he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Behold, it is one people, and one tongue is to all: and they have begun to do this, neither will they leave off from their determinations, till they accomplish them indeed. Come ye therefore, let us go down, and there confound their tongue, that none may hear his neighbour's voice. And so our Lord dispersed them from that place into all lands, and they ceased to build the city. And therefore the name thereof was called Babel, because there the tongue of the whole earth was confounded: and from thence our Lord dispersed them upon the face of all countries. These are the generations of Sem: Sem was an hundred years old when he begat Arphaxad, two years after the flood. And Sem lived after he begat Arphaxad, five hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. Moreover Arphaxad lived thirty five years, and begat Sale. And Arphaxad lived after he begat Sale, three hundred three years, and begat sons and daughters. Sale also lived thirty years, and begat Heber. And Sale lived after he begat Heber, four hundred three years, &amp; begat sons &amp; daughters. And Heber lived thirty four years, and begat Phaleg. And Heber lived after he begat Phaleg, four hundred thirty years, and begat sons and daughters. Phaleg also lived thirty years, and begat Reu. And Phaleg lived after he begat Reu, two hundred nine years, and begat sons and daughters. And Reu lived thirty two years, and begat Sarug. Reu lived also after he begat Sarug, two hundred seven years, and begat sons and daughters. And Sarug lived thirty years, and begat Nachor. And Sarug lived after he begat Nachor, two hundred years, and begat sons and daughters. And Nachor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Thare. And Nachor lived after he begat Thare, and hundred and nineteen years, and begat sons and daughters. And Thare lived seventy years, and begat Abram, and Nachor, and Aran. And these are the generations of Thare: Thare begat Abram, Nachor, and Aran. Moreover Aran begat Lot. And Aran died before Thare his father, in the land of his nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees. And Abram and Nachor married wives: the name of Abram his wife was Sarai: and the name of Nachor his wife, Melcha, the daughter of Aran the father of Melcha, and the father of Jescha. And Sarai was barren, neither had she children. Thare therefore took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Aran, his son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, the wife of Abram his son, and brought them out of Ur of the Chaldees, for to go into the land of Chanaan: and they came as far as Haran, and dwelled there. And the days of Thare came to two hundred five years, and he died in Haran.</div>
