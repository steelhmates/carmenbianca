			<div class='roleText'>This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first in the months of the year. Speak ye to the whole assembly of the children of Israel, and say to them: The tenth day of this month let every man take a lamb by their families and houses. But if the number be less than may suffice to eat the lamb, he shall take unto him his neighbour that joineth to his house, according to the number of souls which may suffice to the eating of the lamb. And it shall be a lamb without spot, a male, of a year old: according also to which rite you shall take a kid. And you shall keep him until the fourteenth day of this month: and the whole multitude of the children of Israel shall sacrifice him at even. And they shall take of the blood thereof, and put upon both the posts, and on the upper door-posts of the houses, wherein they shall eat him. And they shall eat the flesh that night roasted at the fire, and unleavened bread with wild lettuce. You shall not eat thereof any thing raw, nor boiled in water, but only roasted at the fire: the head with the feet and entrails thereof you shall devour. Neither shall there remain any thing of him until morning. If there be any thing left, you shall burn it with fire. And thus you shall eat him: You shall gird your reins, and you shall have shoes on your feet, holding staves in your hands, and you shall eat speedily: for it is the Phase (that is the Passage) of the Lord. And I will pass through the Land of Aegypt that night, and will strike every first-begotten in the Land of Aegypt from man even unto beast: &amp; in all the gods of Aegypt I will do judgments, I^ the Lord. And the blood shall be unto you for a sign in the houses where you shall be: &amp; I shall see the blood, &amp; shall pass over you: neither shall there be among you a destroying plague when I shall strike the Land of Aegypt. And you shall have this day for a monument: &amp; you shall celebrate it solemn to the Lord in your generations with an everlasting observation. Seven days shall you eat azymes: in the first day there shall be no leaven in your houses: whosoever shall eat leaven, that soul shall perish out of Israel, from the first day until the seventh day. The first day shall be holy and solemn, and the seventh day with the like festivity shall be venerable: no work shall you do in them, except those things that pertain to eating. And you shall observe the azymes: for in the self-same day I will bring forth your army out of the Land of Aegypt, and you shall keep this day unto your generations with a perpetual rite. The first month, the fourteenth day of the month at even you shall eat azymes until the one and twentieth day of the same month at even. Seven days there shall not be found leavened in your houses: he that shall eat leavened, his soul shall perish out of the assembly of Israel, as well of strangers as of them that are born in the land. Nothing leavened shall you eat: in all your habitations you shall eat azymes. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Go take a lamb by your families, and sacrifice the Phase. And dip a bunch of hyssop in the blood that is at the door, and sprinkle the upper transom of the door therewith, and both the door cheeks: let none of you go out of the door of his house till morning. For our Lord will pass striking the Aegyptians: and when he shall see the blood on the upper sill, and on both the posts, he will pass over the door of the house, &amp; not suffer the striker to enter your houses and to hurt. Keep this thing as a law to thee and thy children for ever. And When you are entered into the Land which our Lord will give you as he hath promised, you shall observe these ceremonies. And when your children shall say to you: What is this religion? You shall say to them: It is the victim of our Lord's passage, when he passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Aegypt striking the Aegyptians, and delivering our houses. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>And the people bowing themselves adored. And the children of Israel going forth did as our Lord had commanded Moyses &amp; Aaron. And it came to pass at midnight, our Lord struck every first-begotten in the Land of Aegypt, from the first-begotten of Pharao, who sat in his throne, unto the first-begotten of the captive woman that was in the prison, and every first-begotten of beasts. And Pharao arose in the night, &amp; all his servants, &amp; all Aegypt: &amp; there arose a great cry in Aegypt: for neither was there a house wherein there lay not a dead one. And Pharao calling Moyses &amp; Aaron in the night, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The people therefore took dough before it was leavened: and tying it in their cloaks, put it upon their shoulders. And the children of Israel did as Moyses had commanded: &amp; they asked of the Aegyptians vessels of silver and gold, and very much raiment. And our Lord gave grace to the people before the Aegyptians that they did lend them: &amp; they spoiled the Aegyptians. And the children of Israel set forward from Ramesse into Socoth, almost six hundred thousand of foot men, beside little ones. But also the common people of all sorts innumerable went up with them, sheep and herds and beasts of diverse kinds exceeding many. And they baked the meal, which a little before they had taken out of Aegypt tempered: and made hearth cakes unleavened: for it could not be leavened, the Aegyptians urging them to depart, &amp; not suffering them to make any tarriance: neither did they think upon preparing any meat. And the dwelling of the children of Israel that they abode in Aegypt, was four hundred thirty years. The which being expired, the same day all the army of our Lord went forth out of the Land of Aegypt. This is the observable night of our Lord, when he brought them forth out of the Land of Aegypt: this night all the children of Israel must observe in their generations. And our Lord said to Moyses and Aaron: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This is the religion of the Phase: No alien shall eat of it. And every bought servant shall be circumcised, and so shall eat. The stranger and the hireling shall not eat thereof. In one house shall it be eaten, neither shall you carry forth of the flesh thereof out of the house, neither shall you break a bone thereof. All the assembly of the children of Israel shall make it. And if any of the sojourners be willing to dwell among you, and make the Phase of the Lord, first all the male that he hath shall be circumcised, and then shall he celebrate it according to the rite: &amp; he shall be as he that is born in the land: but if there be any man uncircumcised, he shall not eat thereof. All one law shall be to him that is born in the land and to the Proselyte that sojourneth with you. </div>
