			<div class='roleText'>A soft answer breaketh anger: and a hard word raiseth up fury. The tongue of the wise adorneth knowledge: the mouth of fools boileth forth folly. In every place the eyes of our Lord behold the good and the evil. A peaceable tongue is a tree of life: but that which is immoderate, shall break the spirit. A fool scorneth the discipline of his father: but he that regardeth reprehensions, shall become more prudent. In abundant justice there is greater force: but the cogitations of the impious shall be rooted out. The house of the just is very much strength: and in the fruits of the impious is perturbation. The lips of the wise shall sow knowledge: the heart of fools shall be unlike. The victims of the impious are abominable to our Lord: the vows of the just are acceptable. The way of the impious is abomination to our Lord: he that followeth justice is beloved of him. The doctrine is evil of them that forsake the way of life: he that hateth reprehensions shall die. Hell and perdition are before our Lord: how much more the hearts of the children of men? The pestilent man loveth not him that rebuketh him: nor goeth to the wise. A glad heart cheereth the face: in pensiveness of mind the spirit is cast down. The heart of the wise seeketh doctrine: and the mouth of fools is fed with unskillfulness. All the days of the poor are evil: a secure mind is as it were a continual feast. Better is a little with the fear of our Lord, than great treasures and unsatiable. It is better to be called to herbs with charity: than to a fatted calf with hatred. An angry man stirreth brawls: he that is patient appeaseth those that are raised. The way of the slothful is as an hedge of thorns: the way of the just is without offence. A wise son maketh the father joyful: and the foolish man despiseth his mother. Folly is joy to a fool: and the wise man directeth his steps. Cogitations are dissipated where there is no counsel: but where many counsellers are, they are confirmed. A man rejoiceth in the sentence of his mouth: and a word in due time is best. The path of life above the learned, that he may decline from the lowest hell. Our Lord will destroy the house of the proud: and will make sure the borders of the widow. Evil cogitations are an abomination to our Lord: and pure speech most beautiful shall be confirmed of him. He that pursueth avarice disturbeth his house: but he that hateth gifts shall live. By mercy and faith sins are purged: and by the fear of our Lord every one declineth from evil. The mind of the just meditateth obedience: the mouth of the impious redoundeth with evils. Our Lord is far from the impious: and he will hear the prayers of the just. The light of the eyes rejoiceth the soul: a good name fatteth the bones. The ear that heareth the reprehensions of life, shall abide in the midst of the wise. He that rejecteth discipline, despiseth his soul: but he that yieldeth to reprehensions, is a possessor of the heart. The fear of our Lord, the discipline of wisdom: and humility goeth before glory.</div>
