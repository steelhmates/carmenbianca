			<div class='roleText'>Concerning Salomon. O God give thy judgment to the king: and thy justice to the son of the king. To judge thy people in justice, and thy poor in judgment. Let the mountains receive peace for the people: and the little hills justice. He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the children of the poor: and he shall humble the calumniator. And he shall continue with the sun, and before the moon in generation and generation. He shall descend as rain upon a fleece: and as drops distilling upon the earth. There shall rise in his days justice, and aboundance of peace, until the moon be taken away. And he shall rule from sea unto sea: and from the river even to the ends of the round world. Before him shall the Aethiopians fall down: and his enemies shall lick the earth. The kings of Tharsis, and the Islands shall offer presents: the kings of the Arabians, and of Saba shall bring gifts. And all kings of the earth shall adore him: all nations shall serve him. Because he shall deliver the poor from the mighty: and the poor which had no helper. He shall spare the poor and needy: and he shall save the souls of the poor. From usuries and iniquity he shall redeem their souls: and their name shall be honourable before him. And he shall live, and there shall be given him of the gold of Arabia, and they shall adore it always: all the day they shall bless him. And there shall be a firmament in the earth in the tops of mountains, the fruit thereof shall be extolled far above Libanus: and they shall flourish of the city, as the grass of the earth. Be his name blessed for ever: before the sun his name is permanent. And all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed in him: all nations shall magnify him. Blessed be our Lord the God of Israel, who only doth marvelous things. And blessed be the name of his majesty for ever: and all the earth shall be filled with his majesty. Be it, be it. The praises of David, the son of Jesse are ended.</div>
