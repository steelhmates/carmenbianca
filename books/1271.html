			<div class='roleText'>PAUL an Apostle of JESUS Christ by the will of God, according to the promise of the life which is in Christ JESUS: to Timothee my dearest son, grace, mercy, peace from God the Father, and Christ JESUS our Lord. I give thanks to God, whom I serve from my progenitors in a pure conscience, that without intermission I have a memory of thee in my prayers, night and day. desiring to see thee, mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy, calling to mind that faith which is in thee not feigned, which also dwelt first in thy grand-mother Lois, and thy mother Eunice, and I am sure that in thee also. For the which cause I admonish thee that thou resuscitate the grace of God, which is in thee by the imposition of my hands. For God hath not given us the spirit of fear: but of power, and love, and sobriety. Be not therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me his prisoner: but travail with the Gospel according to the power of God, who hath delivered and called us by his holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace, which was given to us in Christ JESUS before the secular times. But it is manifested now by the illumination of our Saviour JESUS Christ, who hath destroyed death, and illuminated life and incorruption by the Gospel: wherein I am appointed a preacher and Apostle and Master of the Gentiles. For the which cause also I suffer these things: but I am not confounded. For I know whom I have believed, and I am sure that he is able to keep my depositum unto that day. Have thou a form of sound words, which thou hast heard of me in faith and in the love of Christ JESUS. Keep the good depositum by the Holy Ghost, which dwelleth in us. Thou knowest this, that all which are in Asia, be averted from me: of whom is Phigelus and Hermogenes. Our Lord give mercy to the house of Onesiphorus: because he hath often refreshed me, and hath not been ashamed of my chain: but when he was come to Rome, he sought me carefully, and found me. Our Lord grant him to find mercy of our Lord in that day. And how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus, thou knowest better.</div>
