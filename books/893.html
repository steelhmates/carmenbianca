			<div class='roleText'>And there came all the Princes of the men of war, and Johanan the son of Caree, and Jezonias the son of Osaias, and the rest of the common people from little unto great: And they said to Jeremy the Prophet: Let our prayer fall in thy sight: and pray for us to the Lord thy God for all this remnant, because we are left few of many, as thine eyes do behold us. And let our Lord thy God tell us the way, by which we may go, and the word that we must do. And Jeremy the Prophet said to them: I have heard: behold I pray to our Lord your God according to your words: every word whatsoever he shall answer me, I will tell you: neither will I conceal from you any thing. And they said to Jeremy: Be our Lord witness between us of truth and faith, if we do not according to every word, for the which our Lord, thy God shall send thee to us. Whether it be good, or evil, we will obey the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee: that it may be well with us, when we shall hear the voice of the Lord our God. And when ten days were accomplished, the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy. And he called Johanan the son of Caree, and all the Princes of the men of war, that were with him, and the whole people from little to great. And he said to them: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel, to whom you sent me, that I should prostrate your prayers in his sight: If resting you will abide in this land, I will build you, and not destroy you; I will plant, and not pluck you up: for now I am pacified upon the evil that I have done to you. Fear not at the face of the king of Babylon, of whom you being fearful are afraid: fear him not, saith our Lord: because I am with you, to save you, and to deliver you out of his hand. And I will give you mercies, and will have mercy upon you, and will make you dwell in your own land. But if you shall say: We will not dwell in this land, neither will we hear the voice of the Lord our God, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>No, not so: but we will go forward to the Land of Aegypt, where we shall not see war, and not hear the sound of the trumpet, and shall not sustain famine: and there we will dwell. For this now hear the word of our Lord ye remnant of Juda: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: If you shall set your face to go into Aegypt, and shall enter to inhabit there: the sword which you fear, shall there take you in the Land of Aegypt: and the famine, for the which you are careful, shall cleave to you in Aegypt, and there you shall die. And all the men, that shall set their face to go into Aegypt, to dwell there, shall die by the sword, and by famine, and by pestilence: none of them shall remain, nor escape from the face of the evil, that I will bring upon them. Because thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: As my fury is poured out, and mine indignation upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so shall mine indignation be poured out upon you, when you shall be entered into Aegypt, and you shall be into an oath, and into astonishment, and into a curse, and into reproach: and you shall no more see this place. The word of our Lord is upon you, o remnant of Juda: Enter not into Aegypt: knowing you shall know that I have adjured you this day, because you have deceived your souls: for you sent me to the Lord our God, saying: </div>
