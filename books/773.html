			<div class='roleText'>The wise man will search out the wisdom of all the ancients, and will be occupied in the prophets. He will keep the narration of famous men, and will enter withal into the subtilties of parables. He will search out the hidden senses of proverbs, and will converse in the secrets of parables. In the midst of great men he will minister, and in the sight of the president he shall appear. He shall pass into the land of strange nations: for he shall try good and evil in men. He will give his heart to watch early unto our Lord, that made him, and he will pray in the sight of the Highest. He will open his mouth in prayer, and will entreat for his sins. For if it shall please our great Lord, he will fill him with the spirit of understanding: and he will pour forth the words of his wisdom as showers, and in prayer will confess to our Lord. And he will direct his counsel, and discipline, and in his secrets he will consult. He will open the discipline of his doctrine, &amp; will glory in the law of the testament of our Lord. Many will praise his wisdom, and it shall not be abolished for ever. The memory of him shall not depart, and his name shall be required from generation to generation. Nations shall declare his wisdom, &amp; the Church will shew forth his praise. If he continue, he shall leave a name more than a thousand: and if he rest, it shall profit him. I will yet consult that I may declare: For as with fury I am replenished. In voice he saith: Hear me ye divine fruits, and as the rose planted upon the rivers of waters fructify ye. As Libanus have ye the odours of sweetness. Flourish ye flowers, as the lily, and give forth an odour, and bring forth leaves in grace, and praise with song, and bless our Lord in his works. Give magnificence to his name, and confess unto him in the voice of your lips, and in songs of the lips, and harps, &amp; thus shall ye say in confession: All the works of our Lord are exceeding good. At his word the water stood as an heap: and at the word of his mouth as it were receptacles of waters: because in his commandment placability is made, and there is no diminishing of his salvation. The works of all flesh are before him, and there is nothing hid from his eyes. From world to world he beholdeth, and nothing is marvelous in his sight. It is not to be said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What is this, or what is that? For all things shall be sought in their time. His blessing hath overflowed as a stream. And as a flood hath watered the dry land, so his wrath shall inherit the nations, that have not sought him: even as he turned waters into drought, &amp; the earth was made dry: and his ways are direct to the ways of them: so to sinners stumbling blocks in his wrath. Good things were created for the good from the beginning, so for the wicked, good things and evil. The beginning of the thing necessary for the life of men, water, fire, and iron, salt, milk, and bread of flour, and honey, and the cluster of grape, and oil, &amp; clothing. All these shall be converted to saints into good, so also to the impious and to sinners into evil. There are spirits, that were created for vengeance, and in their fury they have confirmed their torments: in the time of consummation they shall pour out strength: and they shall accomplish the fury of him, that made them. Fire, hail, famine, and death, all these were created for vengeance: the teeth of beasts, and scorpions, and serpents, and sword revenging the impious unto destruction. In his commandments they shall make merry, and on the earth they shall be prepared when need is, and in their times they shall not pretermit a word. Therefore from the beginning I was confirmed, and I have consulted, and thought, and left written. All the works of our Lord are good, &amp; he will give every work in his hour. It is not to be said: </div>
