But if thou resist, and wilt not dismiss them: behold I will bring in tomorrow the locust into thy coasts: which may cover the face of the earth, that nothing thereof appear, but that which the hail hath left may be eaten: for it shall gnaw all trees that spring in the fields. And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of thy servants, and of all the Aegyptians': such a number as thy fathers have not seen, nor grand-fathers, since they arose upon the earth, until this present day. </div>

Therefore the grass of the earth was devoured, and what fruits soever on the trees, which the hail had left: there was also nothing at all left that was green in the trees, and in the herbs of the earth, in all Aegypt.
