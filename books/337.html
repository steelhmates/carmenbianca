			<div class='roleText'>In his days came up Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, and Joakim was made his servant three years: and he rebelled against him again. And our Lord sent in upon him the rovers of the Chaldees, and the rovers of Syria, and the rovers of Moab, and the rovers of the children of Ammon: and he sent them into Juda, to destroy it, according to the word of our Lord, which he had spoken by his servants the Prophets. And this by the word of our Lord was done against Juda, to take it away before him for all the sins of Manasses which he did, and for the innocent blood, that he had shed, and filled Jerusalem with the blood of innocents: and for this thing God would not be made propitious. But the rest of the words of Joakim, and all that he did, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And Joakim slept with his fathers. and Joachin his son reigned for him. And the king of Aegypt added no more to come out of his country: for the king of Babylon had taken all that had been the king's of Aegypt, from the river of Aegypt, unto the river Euphrates. Eighteen years old was Joachin when he began to reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Nohesta the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem. And he did evil before our Lord, according to all things which his father had done. And that time came up the servants of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon into Jerusalem, &amp; the city was compassed with forts. And Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon came to the city with his servants to assault it. And Joachin the king of Juda went forth to the king of Babylon, he and his mother, and his servants, and his nobles, and his eunuchs: and the king of Babylon received him the eighth year of his reign. And he brought forth from thence all the treasures of the house of our Lord, and the treasures of the king's house: &amp; he cut in pieces all the golden vessels, which Salomon the king of Israel had made in the temple of our Lord, according to the word of our Lord. And he transported all Jerusalem, &amp; all the Princes, and all the strong men of the army, ten thousand into captivity: and every artificer &amp; incloser: and nothing was left, saving the poor sort of the people of the land. He transported also Joachin into Babylon, and the king's mother, and the king's wives, and his eunuchs: and the judges of the land he led into captivity from Jerusalem into Babylon. And all the strong men, seven thousand, and the artificers, and inclosers a thousand, all valiant men and warriors: and the king of Babylon led them captives into Babylon. And he appointed Matthanias his uncle for him: and called his name Sedecias. One and twenty years old was Sedecias when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Amital, the daughter of Jeremie of Lobna. And he did evil before our Lord, according to all things which Joakim had done. For our Lord was wrath against Jerusalem and against Juda, till he cast them away from his face: and Sedecias revolted from the king of Babylon.</div>
