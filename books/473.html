			<div class='roleText'>There was a man in the Land of Hus, named Job, and that man was simple, and right, and fearing God, and departing from evil. And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters. And his possession was seven thousand sheep, &amp; three thousand camels, also five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a family exceeding great: and that man was great among all them of the East. And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat &amp; drink with them. And when the days of feasting had passed about in course, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one. For he said: </div>

But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all things that he possesseth, unless he bless thee in the face. Our Lord therefore said to Satan: behold, all things that he hath, are in thy hand, only upon him extend not thy hand. And Satan went forth from the face of our Lord. And when upon a certain day his sons and daughters did eat, and drink wine in the house of their eldest brother, there came a messenger to Job, which said: </div>
