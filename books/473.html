And there were born to him seven sons and three daughters. And his possession was seven thousand sheep, &amp; three thousand camels, also five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a family exceeding great: and that man was great among all them of the East. And his sons went, and made a feast by houses, every one in his day. And sending they called their three sisters to eat &amp; drink with them. And when the days of feasting had passed about in course, Job sent to them, and sanctified them: and rising up early offered holocausts for every one. For he said: </div>

But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all things that he possesseth, unless he bless thee in the face. Our Lord therefore said to Satan: behold, all things that he hath, are in thy hand, only upon him extend not thy hand. And Satan went forth from the face of our Lord. And when upon a certain day his sons and daughters did eat, and drink wine in the house of their eldest brother, there came a messenger to Job, which said: </div>
