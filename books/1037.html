			<div class='roleText'>The burden of the word of our Lord upon Israel. Saith our Lord extending the heaven, &amp; founding the earth, &amp; forming the spirit of man in him: Behold I will make Jerusalem a lintel of surfeit to all peoples round about: yea and Juda shall be in the siege against Jerusalem. And it shall be: In that day I will make Jerusalem a stone of burden to all peoples: all that shall lift it, shall be torn with tearing, and all the kingdoms of the earth shall be gathered against her. In that day, saith our Lord: I will strike every horse into astonishment, and his rider into madness, and upon the house of Juda I will open mine eyes, and every horse of the peoples I will strike with blindness. And the Dukes of Juda shall say in their heart: Let the inhabitants of Jerusalem be strengthened for me in the Lord of hosts their God. In that day I will make the Dukes of Juda as a furnace of fire amongst sticks, &amp; as a brand of fire in hay: &amp; they shall devour to the right hand, and to the left all people round about: &amp; Jerusalem shall be inhabited again in her place in Jerusalem. And our Lord shall save the tabernacles of Juda, as in the beginning: that the house of David glory not magnifically, and the glory of them that inhabit Jerusalem against Juda. In that day shall our Lord protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, &amp; he that offended of them in that day shall be as David: &amp; the house of David, as of God, as an Angel of our Lord in their sight. And it shall be in that day: I will seek to destroy all Nations, that come against Jerusalem. And I will pour out upon the house of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace, &amp; of prayers: and they shall look toward me, whom they pierced: and they shall lament him with lamentation as it were upon an only begotten, and they shall sorrow upon him, as the manner is to be sorrowful in the death of the first begotten. In that day shall be great lamentation in Jerusalem, as the lamentation of Adadremmon in the field of Mageddon. And the land shall lament: families and families apart: the families of the house of David apart, and their women apart: the families of the house of Nathan apart, and their women apart: the families of the house of Levi apart, &amp; their women apart: the families of Semei apart, and their women apart. All the rest of the families, families and families apart, and their women apart.</div>
