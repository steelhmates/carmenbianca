			<div class='roleText'>AND we desire you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord JESUS Christ, &amp; of our congregation into him; that you be not easily moved from your sense, nor be terrified, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by epistle as sent by us, as though the day of our Lord were at hand. Let no man seduce you by any means, for unless there come a revolt first, and the man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition, which is an adversary &amp; is extolled above all that is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself as though he were God. Remember you not, that when I was yet with you, I told you these things? And now what letteth, you know: that he may be revealed in his time. (For now the mystery of iniquity worketh: only that he which now holdeth, do hold, until he be taken out of the way.) And then that wicked one shall be revealed whom our Lord JESUS shall kill with the spirit of his mouth; and shall destroy with the manifestation of his advent, him, whose coming is according to the operation of Satan, in all power, and lying signs and wonders; and in all seducing of iniquity to them that perish; for that they have not received the charity of the truth that they might be saved. Therefore God will send them the operation of error, to believe lying: that all may be judged which have not believed the truth, but have consented to iniquity. But we ought to give thanks to God always for you, brethren beloved of God, that he hath chosen you first-fruits unto salvation, in sanctification of spirit and faith of the truth: into the which also he hath called you by our Gospel, unto the purchasing of the glory of our Lord JESUS Christ. Therefore, brethren, stand; and hold the traditions which you have learned, whether it be by word, or by our epistle. And our Lord JESUS Christ himself, and God and our Father which hath loved us, and hath given eternal consolation, and good hope in grace, exhort your hearts and confirm you in every good work and word.</div>
