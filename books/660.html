			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Praise ye our Lord because Psalm is good: to our God let there be pleasant and comely praise. Our Lord building up Jerusalem: will gather together the dispersions of Israel. Who healeth the contrite of heart: and bindeth up their sores. Who numbereth the multitude of stars: &amp; giveth names to them all. Great is our Lord, and great is his strength: and of his wisdom there is no number. Our Lord receiving the meek: &amp; humbling sinners even to the ground. Sing ye to our Lord in confession: sing ye to our God on harp. Who covereth the heaven with clouds: and prepareth rain for the earth. Who bringeth forth grass in the mountains: and herb for the service of men. Who giveth to beasts their food: and to the young ravens that call upon him. He shall not have pleasure in the strength of an horse: nor in the legs of a man shall he be well pleased. Our Lord is well pleased toward them that fear him: and in them that hope upon his mercy.</div>
