			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Praise our Lord ye children: praise ye the name of our Lord. Be the name of our Lord blessed, from henceforth now and for ever, From the rising of the sun unto the going down, the name of our Lord is laudable. Our Lord is high above all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Who is as the Lord our God, that dwelleth on high, and beholdeth the low things in heaven and in earth? Raising up the needy from the earth, and lifting up the poor out of the dung: To place him with Princes, with the Princes of his people. Who maketh the barren woman to dwell in a house, a joyful mother of children.</div>
