			<div class='roleText'>Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou shalt be Prince over it. All the ancients therefore of Israel came to the king into Hebron, and David entered into a league with them before our Lord: and they anointed him king over Israel, according to the word of our Lord, which he spake in the hand of Samuel. David also went, and all Israel into Jerusalem. This is Jebus, where the Jebuseites were the inhabiters of the land. And they that dwelt in Jebus, said to David: Thou shalt not come in here. Moreover David took the tower of Sion, which is the City of David, &amp; he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Every one that shall among the first strike the Jebusite, shall be the Prince &amp; chief captain. Joab therefore the son of Sarvia went up first, and was made the Prince. And David dwelt in the tower, and therefore it was called the City of David. And he built the City round about from Mello unto a round compass, and Joab built the rest of the city. And David prospered going and increasing, and the Lord of hosts was with him. These are the Princes of the valiant men of David, which holp him to be made king over all Israel according to the word of our Lord, which he spake to Israel And this is the number of David's strong ones: Jesbaam the son of Hachamoni Prince among thirty: this man lifted up his spear upon three hundred^ wounded at one time. And after him Eleazar his uncle's son an Ahohite, who was among the three mighties. This was with David in Phesdomim, when the Philisthiims were gathered to that place into battle: and the field of that country was full of barley, and the people was fled from the face of the Philisthiims. These stood in the midst of the field, and defended him: and when they had strucken the Philistheans, our Lord gave great health to his people. And there went down three of the thirty Princes to a rock, wherein David was, to the cave of Odollam, when the Philisthiims had camped in the Vale Raphaim. Moreover David was in a hold, and the ward of the Philisthimes in Bethlehem. David therefore desired and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>O that some man would give me water of the cistern of Bethlehem, which is in the gate. These three therefore went forward through the midst of the camp of the Philisthiims, and drew water of the cistern of Bethlehem, which was in the gate, &amp; brought it to David to drink: who would not, but rather offered it to our Lord, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>God forbid that in the sight of my God I should do this, and should drink the blood of these men: because in the peril of their lives they have brought me the water. And for this cause he would not drink. These things did the three most valiants. Abisai also the brother of Joab^ he was Prince of three, and he lifted up his spear against three hundred^ wounded, and he was among three most renowned, and among the second three he the noble one, and Prince of them: but yet unto the three first he raught not. Banaias the son of Joiada a most valiant man, of Cabseel: who had done many facts, he struck the two Ariel of Moab: &amp; he went down, and slew the lion in the midst of the cistern in the time of snow. And he struck the Aegyptian, whose stature was of five cubits, and which had a spear as the weaver's beam: he therefore went down to him with a rod, and by force took away the spear that he held in his hand, and slew him with his own spear. These things did Banaias the son of Joiada, who was among the three valiants most renowned, the first among thirty, but yet the three he raught not: and David made him of his counsel. Moreover the most valiant men in the army, Asahel the brother of Joab, and Elchanan the son of his uncle of Bethlehem, Sammoth an Arorite, Helles a Phalonite, Ira the son of Acces a Thecaite, Abiezer an Anathothite, Sobbochai an Husathite, Ilai an Ahohite, Maharai a Netophathite, Heled the son of Baana a Netophathite.
