			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for Idithun, a psalm to Asaph. With my voice I have cried to our Lord: with my voice to God and he attended to me. In the day of my tribulation I sought God, with my hands in the night before him: and I was not deceived. My soul refused to be comforted, I was mindful of God and was delighted, and was exercised: and my spirit fainted. Mine eyes prevented the watches: I was troubled &amp; spake not.

O God in the holy is thy way: what god is great as our God? thou art the God that doest marvelous things. Thou hast made thy power known among peoples: thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the children of Jacob, and Joseph. The waters saw thee, o God, the waters saw thee: and they were afraid, and the depths were troubled. A multitude of the sounding of waters: the clouds gave a voice. For indeed arrows do pass: the voice of thy thunder in a wheel. Thy lightnings shined to the round world: the earth was moved and troubled. Thy way in the sea, and thy paths in many waters: and thy steps shall not be known. Thou hast conducted thy people as sheep: in the hand of Moyses and Aaron.</div>
