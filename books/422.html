			<div class='roleText'>And in the four and twentieth day of the month the children of Israel came together in fasting and sackcloths, and earth upon them. And the seed of the children of Israel was separated from every strange child: and they stood, and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers. And they rose up to stand: and they read in the volume of the law of our Lord their God four times in a day, and four times they confessed, and adored our Lord their God. And there arose upon the step of the Levites Josue, and Bani, Cedmihel, Sabania, Bonni, Sarebias, Bani, and Chanani: and they cried with a loud voice to our Lord their God. And the Levites Josue and Cedmihel, Bonni, Hasebnia, Serebia, Odaia, Sebnia, and Phathahia, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Arise, Bless our Lord your God from eternity to eternity: and let them bless the high name of thy glory in all blessing and praise. Thou the same, o Lord, alone thou hast made heaven, and all the host thereof: the earth and all things that are in it: the seas and all things that are therein: and thou dost give life to all these things, and the host of heaven adoreth thee. Thou the same o Lord God, which didst choose Abram, and broughtest him out of the fire of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name Abraham. And thou didst find his heart faithful before thee: and thou madest a covenant with him, that thou wouldest give him the land of the Chananeite, of the Hetheite, and of the Amorrheite, and of the Pherezeite, and of the Jebuseite, and of the Gergeseite, to give unto his seed: and thou hast fulfilled thy words, because thou art just. And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Aegypt: and their cry thou didst hear upon the Red sea. And thou gavest signs and wonders in Pharao, and in all his servants, and in all the people of his land: for thou didst know that they had done proudly against them: and thou madest thyself a name, as also at this day. And thou didst divide the sea before them, and they passed through the midst of the sea in dry land: but their persecutors thou threwest into the depth, as a stone into the rough waters. And in a pillar of a cloud thou wast their leader by day, and in a pillar of fire by night, that the way might appear to them, by the which they went. To mount Sinai also thou didst descend, and spakest with them from heaven, and thou gavest them right judgments, and the law of truth, ceremonies, and good precepts. Thy sanctified Sabbath thou didst shew them, and the commandments, and ceremonies, and the law thou didst command them in the hand of Moyses thy servant. Bread also from heaven thou gavest them in their hunger, and water out of the rock thou didst bring forth to them thirsting, and thou saidst to them that they should enter in and possess the land, upon which thou didst lift up thy hand to deliver it them. But they and our fathers did proudly, and hardened their necks, and heard not thy commandments. And they would not hear, and they remembered not thy marvelous works which thou hast done to them. And they hardened their necks, and gave the head to return to their servitude, as it were by contention. But thou a propitious God, &amp; gracious, and merciful, long suffering and of much compassion, didst not forsake them. Yea and when they had made to themselves a molten calf, and had said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This is thy God, which brought thee out of Aegypt: and they did great blasphemies. But thou in thy many mercies didst not leave them in the desert: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by day to lead them into the way, and the pillar of fire by night to shew them the way by which they should go. And thou gavest them thy good spirit, which should teach them, and thy Manna thou didst not withhold from their mouth, and thou gavest them water in thirst. Forty years didst thou feed them in the desert, and nothing was wanting to them, their garments waxed not old, &amp; their feet were not worn. And thou gavest them Kingdoms, &amp; peoples, and didst part lots unto them: and they possessed the land of Sehon, and the land of the king Hesebon, and the land of Og the king of Basan. And thou didst multiply their children as the stars of heaven, and brought them to the land whereof thou hadst said to their fathers, that they should enter and possess it. And the children came, and possessed the land, and thou didst humble before them the inhabiters of the land, the Chananeites, and gavest them into their hand, &amp; their kings, &amp; the peoples of the land, that they might do to them as it pleased them. They therefore took the fenced cities, and fat ground, and possessed houses full of all goods; cisterns made by others, vineyards, and olivets, and many trees that bare fruit: and they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and abounded with delicious things in thy great goodness, But they provoked thee to wrath, and departed from thee, and threw the law behind their backs: and they killed thy Prophets, which admonished them earnestly to return to thee: and they did great blasphemies. And thou gavest them into the hands of their enemies, and they afflicted them. And in the time of their tribulation they cried to thee, and thou from heaven didst hear, and according to thy many compassions gavest them saviours, that should save them from the hand of their enemies. And when they had rested, they returned to do evil in thy sight: and thou didst leave them in the hand of their enemies, and they possessed them. And they returned, and cried to thee: and thou heardest from heaven, and deliveredst them in thy mercies many times. And thou didst admonish them that they should return to thy law. But they did proudly, and heard not thy commandments, and sinned in thy judgments, which a man should do, and shall live in them, and they gave the revolting shoulder, &amp; hardened their neck, neither did they hear. And thou didst prolong many years over them, and didst testify to charge them in thy spirit by the hand of thy Prophets: and they heard not, &amp; thou didst deliver them into the hand of the peoples of the nations. But in thy very many mercies thou madest them not into consumption, neither didst thou forsake them: because a God of compassions and gracious art thou. Now therefore o our God, great, strong, and terrible, keeping covenant and mercy, turn not away from thy face all the labour which hath found us, our kings, &amp; our Princes, and our Priests, and our Prophets, and our fathers, and all the people from the days of the king of Assur, until this day. And thou art just in all things, that have come upon us: because thou hast done truth, but we have done wickedly. Our kings, our Princes, our Priests, and our fathers have not done thy law, and have not attended thy commandments, and thy testimonies which thou hast testified among them. And they in their reigns, and in thy manifold goodness, which thou gavest them, and in the land most large and fat, which thou didst deliver in their sight, served not thee, nor returned from their most wicked devices. Behold we ourselves this day are bondmen: and the land, which thou gavest our fathers, that they should eat the bread thereof, and the good things that are thereof, and ourselves are servants in it. And the fruits thereof are multiplied to the kings, whom thou hast set over us for our sins, and they have dominion over our bodies, and over our beasts, according to their will, and we are in great tribulation. Therefore upon all these things we ourselves make a covenant, and write, and our Princes, our Levites, and our Priests sign it.</div>
