			<div class='roleText'>SEE what manner of charity the Father hath given us, that we should be named and be the sons of God. For this cause the world doth not know us, because it hath not known him. My dearest, now we are the sons of God; &amp; it hath not yet appeared what we shall be. We know that when he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is. And every one that hath this hope in him, sanctifieth himself, as he also is holy. Every one that committeth sin, committeth also iniquity: and sin is iniquity. And you know that he appeared to take away our sins: and sin in him there is none. Every one that abideth in him, sinneth not: and every one that sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him. Little children, let no man seduce you. He that doeth justice, is just: even as he also is just. He that committeth sin, is of the devil: because the devil sinneth from the beginning. For this, appeared the Son of God, that he might dissolve the works of the devil. Every one that is born of God, committeth not sin: because his seed abideth in him, and he cannot sin because he is born of God. In this are the children of God manifest, and the children of the devil. Every one that is not just, is not of God, and he that loveth not his brother. Because this is the annunciation, which you have heard from the beginning, That you love one another. Not as Cain, who was of the wicked, and killed his brother. And for what cause killed he him? Because his works were wicked: but his brother's, just. Marvel not, brethren, if the world hate you. We know that we are translated from death to life, because we love the brethren. He that loveth not, abideth in death. Whosoever hateth his brother, is a murderer. And you know that no murderer hath life everlasting abiding in himself. In this we have known the charity of God, because he hath yielded his life for us: and we ought to yield our lives for the brethren. He that shall have the substance of the world, and shall see his brother have need, and shall shut his bowels from him: how doth the charity of God abide in him? My little children, let us not love in word, nor in tongue, but in deed and truth. In this we know that we are of the truth: and in his sight we shall persuade our hearts. For if our heart do reprehend us, God is greater than our heart, and knoweth all things. My dearest, if our heart do not reprehend us, we have confidence toward God. And whatsoever we shall ask, we shall receive of him: because we keep his commandments, and do those things which are pleasing before him. And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son JESUS Christ: and love one another, as he hath given commandment unto us. And he that keepeth his commandments, abideth in him, and he in him. And in this we know that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which he hath given us.</div>
