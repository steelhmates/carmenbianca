			<div class='roleText'>Take unto thee also Aaron thy brother with his sons, from among the children of Israel that they may do the function of priesthood unto me: Aaron, Nadab, and Abiu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. And thou shalt make an holy vesture to Aaron thy brother for glory and beauty. And thou shalt speak to all the wise of heart, whom I have replenished with the spirit of wisdom, that they make Aaron's vestures, wherein he being sanctified may minister to me. And these shall be the vestments that they shall make: Rationale and an Ephod, a tunic and a strait linen garment, a mitre and a girdle. They shall make the holy vestments for thy brother Aaron and his sons, that they may do the function of priesthood unto me. And they shall take gold, and hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and silk. And they shall make the Ephod of gold and hyacinth and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and twisted silk, embroidered with diverse colours. It shall have two edges joined in the top on both sides, that they may be closed together. The very workmanship also and all the variety of the work shall be of gold and hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and twisted silk. And thou shalt take two Onyx stones, and shalt grave in them the names of the children of Israel: six names in one stone, and the other six in the other, according to the order of their nativity. After the work of a graver and the graving of a lapidary, thou shalt grave them with the names of the children of Israel, set in gold and compassed about: and thou shalt put them in both sides of the Ephod, a memorial for the children of Israel. And Aaron shall bear their names before the Lord upon both shoulders, for a remembrance. Thou shalt make also hooks of gold, and two little chains of most pure gold linked one to another, which thou shalt put into the hooks. The Rationale of judgment also thou shalt make with embroidered work of diverse colours, according to the workmanship of the Ephod of gold, hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and twisted silk. It shall be four square and double: it shall have the measure of a palm as well in length as in breadth. And thou shalt set in it four rews of stones: In the first rew shall be the stone sardius, and topazius, and the emerald: in the second the carbuncle, the sapphire, &amp; the jasper: in the third a ligurius, an achates, an amethyst: in the fourth a chrysolith, an onyx, and berillus. They shall be set in gold by their rews. And they shall have the names of the children of Israel: with twelve names shall they be graven, every stone with the names of every one according to the twelve tribes. Thou shalt make in the Rationale chains linked one to another of the purest gold: and two rings of gold, which thou shalt put in both the tops of the Rationale: and the golden chains thou shalt join to the rings, that are in the edges thereof: and the ends of the chains themselves thou shalt couple with two hooks on both sides of the Ephod, which is toward the Rationale. Thou shalt make also two rings of gold which thou shalt put in the tops of the Rationale, in the brims, that are over against the Ephod, &amp; look toward the back parts thereof. Moreover also other two rings of gold, which are to be set on both sides of the Ephod beneath, that looketh toward the nether joining, that the Rationale may be fitted with the Ephod, and may be fastened by the rings thereof unto the rings of the Ephod with a lace of hyacinth, that the joining artificially wrought may continue, &amp; the Rationale &amp; Ephod may not be separated one from the other. And Aaron shall bear the names of the children of Israel in the Rationale of judgment upon his breast, when he shall enter into the Sanctuary, a memorial before the Lord for ever. And thou shalt put in the Rationale of Judgment^ Doctrine, and Verity, which shall be on Aaron's breast, when he shall go in before the Lord: and he shall bear the judgment of the children of Israel on his breast, in the sight of the Lord always. And thou shalt make the tunic of the Ephod all of hyacinth, in the midst whereof above shall be a hole for the head, and a border round about it woven, as is wont to be made in the utmost parts of garments, that it may not easily be broken. And beneath at the feet of the same tunic, round about, thou shalt make as it were pomegranates, of hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, little bells interposed between, so that there be a bell of gold and a pomegranate; and again another bell of gold &amp; a pomegranate. And Aaron shall be vested with it in the office of his ministry, that the sound may be heard, when he goeth in &amp; cometh out of the Sanctuary, in the sight of the Lord, &amp; that he die not. Thou shalt make also a plate of the purest gold: wherein thou shalt grave after the work of a graver, Holy to the Lord. And thou shalt tie it with a lace of hyacinth, and it shall be upon the mitre, hanging over the forehead of the High-Priest. And Aaron shall carry the iniquities of those things, which the children of Israel have offered and sanctified, in all their gifts and donaries. And the plate shall be always in his forehead, that the Lord may be well pleased with them. And thou shalt gird the tunic with silk, and thou shalt make a silken mitre, and a bawdrike of embroidered work. Moreover for the sons of Aaron thou shalt prepare linen tunics, and bawdrikes, and mitres for glory and beauty: And with all these things thou shalt vest Aaron thy brother, and his sons with him. And thou shalt consecrate the hands of them all, and shalt sanctify them, that they may do the function of priesthood unto me. Thou shalt make also linen breeches, to cover the flesh of their turpitude from the reins unto the thighs: and Aaron and his sons shall use them when they shall enter into the tabernacle of testimony, or when they approach to the Altar to minister in the Sanctuary, lest guilty of iniquity they die. It shall be a law for ever to Aaron and to his seed after him.</div>
