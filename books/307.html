			<div class='roleText'>And the word of our Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasa, saying: For so much as I have exalted thee out of the dust, and set thee duke over my people Israel, but thou hast walked in the way of Jeroboam, and hast made my people Israel to sin, that thou mightest anger me with their sins: behold, I will cut down the posterity of Baasa, and the posterity of his house, and I will make thy house as the house of Jeroboam the son of Nabat. Whosoever of Baasa shall die in the city, him shall the dogs eat: and whosoever of his shall die in the country, him shall the fowls of the air devour. But the rest of the words of Baasa, and whatsoever he did, and his battles, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Baasa therefore slept with his fathers, and was buried in Thersa: and Ela his son reigned for him. And when the word of our Lord came in the hand of Jehu the son of Hanani the Prophet against Baasa, and against his house, &amp; against all the evil, that he had done before our Lord, to anger him in the works of his hands, that it should be made as the house of Jeroboam: for this cause he slew him, that is to say, Jehu the son of Hanani, the Prophet. In the six and twentieth year of Asa the king of Juda, reigned Ela the son of Baasa over Israel in Thersa two years. And his servant Zambri rebelled against him, the captain of the half part of the horsemen: and Ela was in Thersa drinking, and drunken in the house of Arsa the governor of Thersa. Zambri therefore rushing in, struck and slew him in the seven &amp; twentieth year of Asa the king of Juda, and he reigned for him. And when he reigned, and sat upon his throne, he struck all the house of Baasa, and he left not of it one that could piss against a wall, and his kinsfolk and friends. And Zambri destroyed all the house of Baasa, according to the word of our Lord, that he had spoken to Baasa in the hand of Jehu the Prophet, for all the sins of Baasa, and the sins of Ela his son, who sinned, and made Israel to sin, provoking our Lord the God of Israel in their vanities. But the rest of the words of Ela, and all that he did, are not these written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? In the seven and twentieth year of Asa the king of Juda, reigned Zambri seven days in Thersa: moreover the army besieged Gebbethon a city of the Philisthiims. And when they heard that Zambri had rebelled, and slain the king, all Israel made Amri their king, who was General of the warfare over Israel that day, in the camp. Amri therefore went up, and all Israel with him from Gebbethon, and they besieged Thersa. And Zambri seeing that the city should be taken, he went into the palace, &amp; burnt himself with the king's house: and he died in his sins, which he had sinned doing evil before our Lord, and walking in the way of Jeroboam, and in his sin, wherewith he made Israel to sin. But the rest of the words of Zambri, and of his treason, and tyranny, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? Then was the people of Israel divided into two parts: the half part of the people followed Thebni the son of Gineth, to make him king: &amp; the half part Amri. But the people that was with Amri, prevailed over the people that followed Thebni the son of Gineth: and Thebni died, and Amri reigned. In the one and thirtieth year of Asa the king of Juda^ Amri reigned over Israel, twelve years: in Thersa he reigned six years. And he bought the mount of Samaria of Somer for two talents of silver: &amp; he built it, and he called the city which he had built by the name of Semer the lord of the mount of Samaria. And Amri did evil in the sight of our Lord, &amp; wrought wickedly above all, that were before him. And he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nabat, and in his sins wherewith he made Israel to sin: that they might anger our Lord the God of Israel in their vanities. But the rest of the words of Amri, and the battles he made, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Israel? And Amri slept with his fathers, and was buried in Samaria, and Achab his son reigned for him. But Achab the son of Amri reigned over Israel the eight &amp; thirtieth year of Asa the king of Juda. And Achab the son of Amri reigned over Israel in Samaria two and twenty years. And Achab the son of Amri did evil in the sight of our Lord above all that were before him. Neither did it suffice him that he walked in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nabat: besides he took to wife Jezabel the daughter of Ethbaul the king of the Sidonians. And he went, and served Baal, and adored him. And he set an altar to Baal in the temple of Baal, which he had built in Samaria, and he planted a grove: and Achab added in his work, provoking our Lord the God of Israel above all the kings of Israel, that were before him. In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho: in Abiram his first born he founded it, and in Segub his last he set up the gates thereof: according to the word of our Lord, which he spake in the hand of Josue the son of Nun.</div>
