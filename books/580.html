			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, in hymns, a Psalm of Canticle to David. God have mercy upon us, and bless us: illuminate his countenance upon us, and have mercy on us. That we may know thy way upon earth: in all nations thy salvation. Let peoples, o God, confess to thee: let all peoples confess to thee. Let nations be glad &amp; rejoice: because thou judgest peoples in equity, and the nations in earth thou doest direct. Let peoples, o God, confess to thee, let all peoples confess to thee: the earth hath yielded her fruit. God, our God bless us, God bless us: and let all the ends of the earth fear him.</div>
