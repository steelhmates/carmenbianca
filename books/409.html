			<div class='roleText'>Then Darius the king commanded, and they searched in the library of the Books, that were laid up in Babylon, and there was found in Ecbatanis, which is a castle in the province Medena, one volume, &amp; there was such a commentary written therein: In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king decreed, that the house of God should be built, which is in Jerusalem, in the place where they immolate hosts, &amp; that they lay the foundations supporting the height of threescore cubits, &amp; the breadth of threescore cubits, three rews of stones unpolished, and so many rews of new timber: and the costs shall be given out of the king's house. Yea and the vessels of the temple of God, of gold and of silver, which Nabuchodonosor had taken out of the Temple of Jerusalem, and had brought them into Babylon, let them be restored, and brought back into the temple of Jerusalem unto their place, which also were put in the temple of God. Now therefore Thathanai Prince of the country, that is beyond the River, Stharbuzanai, and your counsellers the Apharsacheites, which are beyond the River, depart far from them, and suffer that temple of God to be made of the Duke of the Jews, and of their ancients, that they may build that house of God in his place. Also there is commandment given from me what must be done of those ancients of the Jews, that the house of God may be built, to wit, that of the king's coffer, that is, of the tributes that are given out of the country beyond the River, the charges be diligently given to those men, lest the work be hindered. And if it shall be necessary, calves also, and lambs, and kids, for holocaust to the God of heaven, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the rite of the Priests that are in Jerusalem, let there be given them day by day, that there be no complain in any thing. And let them offer oblations to the God of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his children. By me therefore there is a decree made: That every man, which shall alter this commandment, there be a beam taken of his house, and set up, and he be fast hanged upon it, and his house be confiscate. And the God, that hath made his name to dwell there, destroy all Kingdoms, and the people that shall extend their hand to resist, and to destroy the house of God, that is in Jerusalem. I^ Darius have made the decree, which I will to be diligently accomplished. Therefore Thathanai the Prince of the country beyond the River, and Stharbuzanai, and his counsellers, according to that which Darius the king had commanded, so did execute it diligently. And the ancients of the Jews built, and prospered according to the prophecy of Aggeus the Prophet, and of Zacharias the son of Addo: and they built &amp; set up, the God of Israel commanding, and Cyrus commanding, and Darius, and Artaxerxes the kings of the Persians. And they were finishing this house of God, until the third day of the month of Adar, which is the sixth year of Darius the king. And the children of Israel, the Priests and the Levites, and the rest of the transmigration, made the dedication of the house of God in joy. And they offered in the dedication of the house of God, calves an hundred, rams two hundred, lambs four hundred, buck-goats for the sin of all Israel twelve, according to the number of the tribes of Israel. And they set the Priests in their orders, and the Levites in their courses over the works of God in Jerusalem, as it is written in the Book of Moyses. And the children of Israel of the transmigration made the Phase, the fourteenth day of the first month. For all the Priests and the Levites were purified as it were one man: all clean to immolate the Phase for all the children of the transmigration, and for their brethren the Priests, and themselves. And the children of Israel that were returned from the transmigration, did eat, and all that had separated themselves from the coinquination of the Gentiles of the earth unto them, to seek our Lord the God of Israel. And they made the solemnity of Azymes seven days in joy, because our Lord had made them joyful, and had turned the heart of the king of Assur to them, that he should help their hands in the work of the house of our Lord the God of Israel.</div>
