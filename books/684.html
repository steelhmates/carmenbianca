			<div class='roleText'>Wine is a luxurious thing, &amp; drunkenness tumultuous: whosoever is delighted therewith shall not be wise. As the roaring of a lion, so also the terror of a king: he that provoketh him, sinneth also against his own soul. It is honour to a man that separateth himself from contentions: but all fools meddle with contumelies. Because of cold the slothful would not plow: he shall beg therefore in the summer, and it shall not be given him. As deep water, so counsel in the heart of a man: but a wise man shall draw it out. Many men are called merciful: but a faithful man who shall find? The just that walketh in his simplicity, shall leave blessed children. The king that sitteth in the throne of judgment, dissipateth all evil with his look. Who can say: My heart is clean, I am pure from sin? Weight and weight, measure and measure: both are abominable before God. By his conversation a child is perceived, if his works be clean and right. The ear hearing, and the eye seeing, our Lord made both. Love not sleep, lest poverty oppress thee: open thine eyes and be filled with breads. It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer: and when he is departed he will boast. There is gold, and multitude of pearls: but a precious vessel the lips of knowledge. Take his garment, that was the surety of a stranger, and for strangers take a pledge from him. The bread of lying is sweet to a man: and afterward his mouth shall be filled with the gravel stone. Cogitations are strengthened by counsels: and battles are to be handled by governments. Meddle not with him that revealeth mysteries, and walketh fraudulently, and dilateth his lips. He that curseth his father, and mother, his lamp shall be extinguished in the midst of darkness. The inheritance whereunto haste is made in the beginning, in the later end shall lack blessing. Say not, I will requite evil: expect our Lord, and he will deliver thee. Weight and weight are abomination with our Lord: a deceitful balance is not good. The steps of man are directed of our Lord: but who of men can understand his own way? It is ruin to a man to devour saints, and afterward to retract the vows. A wise king dissipateth the impious, and bendeth over them a triumphant arch. The lamp of our Lord, the breath of a man, which searcheth all the secrets of the belly. Mercy &amp; truth keep the king, and his throne is strengthened by clemency. The joy of youngmen their strength: and the dignity of oldmen a gray head. The blueness of the wound shall wipe away evils: and stripes in the more secret place of the belly.</div>
