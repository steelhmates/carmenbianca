			<div class='roleText'>Send forth o Lord the lamb the dominatour of the earth, from the Rock of the desert, to the mount of the daughter of Sion. And he shall be as a bird flying, and the young flying out of the nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be in the passage of Arnon. Take counsel, gather a council: set thy shadow in the midday as it were night: hide them that fly, and them that wander bewray not.

And it shall be: when it shall appear that Moab hath laboured for his excelses, he shall go into his sanctuaries to pray, &amp; shall not prevail.
