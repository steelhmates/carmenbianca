			<div class='roleText'>Send forth o Lord the lamb the dominatour of the earth, from the Rock of the desert, to the mount of the daughter of Sion. And he shall be as a bird flying, and the young flying out of the nest, so shall the daughters of Moab be in the passage of Arnon. Take counsel, gather a council: set thy shadow in the midday as it were night: hide them that fly, and them that wander bewray not. My fugitives shall dwell with thee: Moab be thou their covert from the face of the destroyer: for the dust is ended, the wretch is come to naught: he hath failed, that trod down the earth.

He shall not tread wine in the press that was wont to tread: the voice of the treaders I have taken away. For this my belly shall sound as an harp to Moab, &amp; my bowels to the wall of baked brick. And it shall be: when it shall appear that Moab hath laboured for his excelses, he shall go into his sanctuaries to pray, &amp; shall not prevail. This is the word, that our Lord spake to Moab from that time: and now our Lord hath spoken saying: </div>
