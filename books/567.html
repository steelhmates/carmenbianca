			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, in songs^ understanding for David when the Zipheites were come, and said to Saul: Is not David hid with us? O God save me in thy name: and in thy strength judge me. O God hear my prayer with thine ears: receive the words of my mouth. Because strangers have risen up against me, &amp; the strong have sought my soul: and they have not set God before their eyes. For behold God helpeth me: and our Lord is the receiver of my soul. Turn away the evils of mine enemies: and in thy truth destroy them. I will voluntarily sacrifice to thee, and will confess to thy name o Lord, because it is good: Because thou hast delivered me out of all tribulation: and mine eye hath looked down upon mine enemies.</div>
