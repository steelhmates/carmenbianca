			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord came from Sinai, and from Seir is he risen to us: he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him thousands of Saints. In his right hand a fiery law. He hath loved the peoples, all the Saints are in his hand: and they that approach to his feet shall receive of his doctrine. Moyses commanded us a law, the inheritance of the multitude of Jacob. He shall be king with the most right, the Princes of the people being assembled with the tribes of Israel. Live Ruben, and die he not, and be he little in number. This is the blessing of Judas: Hear Lord the voice of Judas, and bring him in unto his people: his hands shall fight for him, and he shall be his helper against his adversaries. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Thy perfection, and thy doctrine be to thy holy man, whom thou hast proved in tentation, and judged at the Waters of contradiction. He that said to his father and to his mother: I know you not; and to his brethren: I know you not: and they knew not their children. These kept thy word, and observed thy covenant, thy judgments, o Jacob, and thy law, o Israel: they shall put incense in thy fury, and holocaust upon thine altar. Bless Lord his strength, and receive the works of his hands. Strike the backs of his enemies, and they that hate him, let them not rise up. </div>

These are the multitudes of Ephraim, and these the thousands of Manasses. </div>

Blessed art thou Israel: who is like to thee, o people that art saved in our Lord, the shield of thy help, and the sword of thy glory? Thy enemies shall deny thee, and thou shalt tread their necks.</div>
