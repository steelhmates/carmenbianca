			<div class='roleText'>The word that was made to Jeremy from our Lord in the days of Joakim the son of Josias the king of Juda, saying: Go to the house of the Rechabites: and speak to them, &amp; thou shalt bring them into the house of our Lord, into one chamber of the treasuries, &amp; thou shalt give them wine to drink. And I took Jezonias the son of Jeremias the son of Habsamias, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites. And I brought them into the house of our Lord, to the treasure-house of the sons of Hanan, the son of Jegedelias the man of God, which was by the treasure-house of the Princes, above the treasure of Maasias the son of Sellum, who was keeper of the entry. And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites goblets full of wine, and cups: and I said to them: Drink ye wine. Who answered: We will not drink wine: because Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>You shall not drink wine, you and your children for ever. And you shall not build house, and you shall not sow seed, and you shall not plant vineyards, nor have any: but you shall dwell in tabernacles all your days, that you may live many days upon the face of the land, wherein you are strangers. We therefore have obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, in all things that he commanded us: so that we drank not any wine all our days: we and our wives, our sons &amp; our daughters. And we builded not houses to inhabit, and vineyard, and field, and seed we have not had: but we have dwelt in tabernacles, and have been obedient according to all things that Jonadab our father commanded us. But when Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon was come up to our Land, we said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Come, and let us go into Jerusalem from the face of the host of the Chaldees, &amp; from the face of the host of Syria: &amp; we have tarried in Jerusalem. And the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Go, &amp; say to the men of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: Why will you not receive discipline, to obey my words, saith our Lord? The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab have prevailed, which he commanded his sons not to drink wine: &amp; they have not drunk until this day, because they have obeyed the commandment of their father: but I have spoken to you, early rising and speaking, and you have not obeyed me. And I have sent to you all my servants the Prophets, rising early, and sending and saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Return ye every one from his most wicked way, and make your studies good: &amp; follow not strange gods, nor worship them, and you shall dwell in the land which I gave you and your fathers: and you have not inclined your ear, nor heard me. The children therefore of Jonadab the son of Rechab have firmly kept the precept of their father, which he commanded them: but this people hath not obeyed me. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, all the affliction which I have spoken against them, because I have spoken to them, and they have not heard: I have called them, and they have not answered me. But to the house of the Rechabites Jeremy said: </div>
