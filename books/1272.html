			<div class='roleText'>THOU therefore my son, be strong in the grace which is in Christ JESUS: and the things which thou hast heard of me by many witnesses, these commend to faithful men, which shall be fit to teach others also. Labour thou as a good soldier of Christ JESUS. No man being a soldier to God, entangleth himself with secular businesses; that he may please him to whom he hath approved himself. For he also that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned unless he strive lawfully. The husband-man that laboureth, must first take of the fruits. Understand what I say: for our Lord will give thee in all things understanding. Be mindful that our Lord JESUS Christ is risen again from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my Gospel, wherein I labour even unto bands, as a malefactor: but the word of God is not tied. Therefore I sustain all things for the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation, which is in Christ JESUS, with heavenly glory. A faithful saying. For if we be dead with him, we shall live also together. If we shall sustain, we shall also reign together. If we shall deny, he also will deny us. If we believe not; he continueth faithful, he cannot deny himself. These things admonish: testifying before our Lord. Contend not in words, for it is profitable for nothing, but for the subversion of them that hear. Carefully provide to present thyself approved to God, a work-man not to be confounded, rightly handling the word of truth. But profane and vain speeches avoid: for they do much grow to impiety: and their speech spreadeth as a canker: of whom is Hymenaeus and Philetus: who have erred from the truth, saying that the resurrection is done already, and have subverted the faith of some. But the sure foundation of God standeth, having this seal, Our Lord knoweth, who be his, and let every one depart from iniquity that nameth the name of our Lord. But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and of silver, but also of wood and of earth: and certain indeed unto honour, but certain unto contumely. If any man therefore shall cleanse himself from these, he shall be a vessel unto honour, sanctified &amp; profitable to our Lord, prepared to every good work. But youthful desires^ fly, and pursue justice, faith, charity, and peace with them that invocate our Lord from a pure heart. And foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they engender brawls. But the servant of our Lord must not wrangle: but be mild toward all men, apt to teach, patient, with modesty admonishing them that resist the truth: lest sometime God give them repentance to know the truth: and they recover themselves from the snares of the devil, of whom they are held captive at his will.</div>
