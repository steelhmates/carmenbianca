			<div class='roleText'>Hiram also the king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and cedar trees, and artificers for walls, and timber, to build him a house. And David knew that our Lord had established him to be king over Israel, and that his Kingdom was exalted over his people Israel. David also took other wives in Jerusalem: and he begat sons, and daughters. And these be their names, that were born to him in Jerusalem: Samua, and Sobab, Nathan, and Salomon. Jebahar, and Elisua, and Eliphalet, Noga also, and Napheg, and Japhia, Elisama, and Baalaida, and Eliphalet. And the Philisthiims hearing that David was anointed for king over all Israel, they went up all to seek him: which when David had heard, he went out to meet them.

And they left there their gods, which David commanded to be burnt. And other time also the Philisthiims invaded, and were dispersed in the Vale. And David consulted God again, and God said to him: Go not up after them, retire from them, &amp; thou shalt come against them over against the pear-trees. And when thou shalt hear the sound of one going in the top of the pear-trees, then shalt thou issue forth to battle. For God is gone forth before thee, to strike the camp of the Philisthiims. David therefore did as God had commanded him, &amp; struck the camp of the Philisthians from Gabaon unto Gazera. And the name of David was bruited in all countries, and our Lord gave the dread of him over all nations.</div>
