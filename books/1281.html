			<div class='roleText'>WHEREFORE, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly vocation, consider the Apostle, and high Priest of our confession JESUS: who is faithful to him that made him, as also Moyses in all his house. For, this man is esteemed worthy of more ample glory above Moyses, by so much as more ample glory than the house, hath he that framed it. For every house is framed of some man. But he that created all things, is God. And Moyses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be said: but Christ as the Son in his own house: which house are we, if we keep firm the confidence and glory of hope unto the end. Wherefore, as the Holy Ghost saith, Today if you shall hear his voice, harden not your hearts as in the exacerbation according to the day of tentation in the desert, where your fathers tempted me: proved and saw my works forty years. For the which cause I was offended with this Generation, and said, They do always err in heart. And they have not known my ways. to whom I sware in my wrath, If they shall enter into my rest. Beware brethren, lest perhaps there be in some of you an evil heart of incredulity, to depart from the living God. But exhort yourselves every day, whiles today is named, that none of you be obdurate with the fallacy of sin. For we be made partakers of Christ: yet so if we keep the beginning of his substance firm unto the end. While it is said, Today if you shall hear his voice, do not obdurate your hearts as in that exacerbation. For some hearing did exasperate: but not all they that went out of Aegypt by Moyses. And with whom was he offended forty years? was it not with them that sinned, whose carcasses were overthrown in the desert? And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest: but to them that were incredulous? And we see that they could not enter in, because of incredulity.</div>
