			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm to David himself. Sing ye to our Lord a new song: because he hath done marvelous things. His right hand hath wrought salvation to himself: and his arm is holy. Our Lord hath made known his salvation: in the sight of the Gentiles he hath revealed his justice. He hath remembered his mercy, and his truth to the house of Israel. All the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of our God. Make ye jubilation to God all the earth: chant, and rejoice, and sing. Sing to our Lord on harp, on harp and voice of Psalm: on long drawn trumpets, and voice of cornet of horn. Make jubilation in the sight of the King our Lord: let the sea be moved, and the fullness thereof: the round world, and they that dwell therein. The rivers shall clap with hand: the mountains together shall rejoice at the sight of our Lord: because he cometh to judge the earth. He will judge the round earth in justice, and the peoples in equity.</div>
