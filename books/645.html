			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. Remember David, o Lord, and all his meekness: As he sware to our Lord, vowed a vow to the God of Jacob. If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house, if I shall ascend into the bed of my couch. If I shall give sleep to mine eyes, and slumbering to mine eye lids: And rest to my temples: until I find a place for our Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. Behold we have heard of it in Ephrata: we have found it in the fields of the wood. We will enter into his tabernacle: we will adore in the place where his feet stood. Arise Lord into thy rest, thou, and the ark of thy sanctification. Let thy Priests be clothed with justice: &amp; let thy saints rejoice. For David thy servant's sake, turn not away the face of thy Christ. Our Lord hath sworn truth to David, and he will not disappoint it: Of the fruit of thy womb I will set upon thy seat. If thy children shall keep my testament, and these my testimonies which I will teach them: Their children also even for ever, shall sit upon thy seat. Because our Lord hath chosen Sion: he hath chosen it for an habitation to himself. This is my rest for ever and ever: here will I dwell because I have chosen it. Blessing I will bless her widow: her poor I will fill with breads. Her Priests I will clothe with salvation: and her saints shall rejoice with joyfulness. Thither will I bring forth a horn to David, I have prepared a lamp to my Christ. His enemies I will clothe with confusion: but upon him shall my sanctification flourish.</div>
