			<div class='roleText'>And after they had supped, they brought in the young man to her. Tobias therefore remembering the Angel's word, brought forth out of his bag part of the liver, &amp; laid it upon live coals. Then Raphael the Angel took the devil, &amp; bound him in the desert of higher Aegypt. Then Tobias exhorted the virgin, &amp; said to her: Sara arise, &amp; let us pray to God today, and tomorrow, and the next morrow: because these three nights we are joined to God: &amp; when the third night is past, we will be in our wedlock. For we are the children of holy men, and we may not be joined together as gentiles, that know not God. And they rising together, prayed both together that health might be given them. And Tobias said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lord God of our fathers, the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and fountains, and rivers, and all thy creatures that are in them, bless thee. Thou madest Adam of the slime of the earth, and gavest him Eve an helper. And now Lord thou knowest, that not for fleshly lust do I take my sister to wife, but only for the love of posterity, in the which thy name may be blessed for ever &amp; ever. Sara also said. Have mercy on us Lord, have mercy upon us, and let us grow old both together in health. And it came to pass about the cocks' crowing, Raguel bade his servants to be called for, and they went with him together to dig a grave. For he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lest perhaps it may chance to him, as also to the other seven husbands that went in unto her. And when they had prepared the pit, Raguel returning to his wife, said to her: Send one of thy handmaids, &amp; let her see if he be dead, that I may bury him before it be day. But she sent one of her handmaids, who going into the chamber, found them safe &amp; sound, sleeping both together. And returning she brought good tidings: and they blessed our Lord, to wit, Raguel &amp; Anna his wife, &amp; said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>We bless thee Lord God of Israel, because it hath not chanced as we thought. For thou hast done thy mercy with us, &amp; hast excluded from us the enemy, that persecuted us. And thou hast taken pity upon two^ the only children. Make them Lord bless thee more fully, &amp; to offer up to thee a sacrifice of thy praise, and of their health, that all nations may know, that thou art God only in all the earth. And forthwith Raguel commanded his servants, that they should fill up the pit which they had made, before it were day. And he bade his wife make ready a feast, and prepare all things, that for victuals were necessary to them that go a journey. He caused also two fat kine, and four wethers to be killed, and great cheer to be prepared for all his neighbours and all his friends. And Raguel adjured Tobias that he should abide with him two weeks. And of all things which Raguel possessed, he gave the half part to Tobias, and made this writing, that the half part, which was remaining after their decease, should come to the dominion of Tobias.</div>
