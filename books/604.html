			<div class='roleText'>Praise of a Canticle to David. He that dwelleth in the help of the Highest, shall abide in the protection of the God of heaven. He shall say to our Lord: Thou art my protector, and my refuge: my God I will hope in him. Because he hath delivered me from the snare of the hunters, and from the sharp word. With his shoulders shall he overshadow thee: and under his wings thou shalt hope. With shield shall his truth compass thee: thou shalt not be afraid of the fear in the night. Of the arrow flying in the day, of business walking in darkness: of invasion, and the midday devil. A thousand shall fall on thy side, &amp; ten thousand on thy right hand: but to thee it shall not approach. But thou shalt consider with thine eyes: and shalt see the retribution of sinners. Because thou o Lord art my hope: thou hast made the Highest thy refuge. There shall no evil come to thee: and scourge shall not approach to thy tabernacle. Because he hath given his Angels charge of thee: that they keep thee in all thy ways. In their hands they shall bear thee: lest perhaps thou knock thy foot against a stone. Upon the asp and the basiliscus thou shall walk: &amp; thou shalt tread upon the lion, and the dragon. Because he hath hoped in me, I will deliver him: I will protect him, because he hath known my name. He shall cry to me, and I will hear him: with him I am in tribulation: I will deliver him, and will glorify him. With length of days I will replenish him: and I will shew him my salvation.</div>
