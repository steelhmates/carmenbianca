			<div class='roleText'>The words of Amos, who was among the Pastors of Thecua: Which he saw upon Israel in the days of Ozias the king of Juda, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joas the king of Israel, two years before the earth-quake. And he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord will roar out of Sion, and out of Jerusalem he will give his voice: and the beautiful places of the Pastors have mourned and the top of Carmel is withered. Thus saith our Lord: Upon three wickednesses of Damascus, &amp; upon four I will not convert it: because they have threshed Galaad with iron wains. And I will send fire into the house of Azael, and it shall devour the houses of Benadad. And I will break the bar of Damascus: &amp; I will destroy the inhabitant out of the idol, and him that holdeth the sceptre out of the house of pleasure: and the people of Syria shall be transported to Cyrene, saith our Lord. Thus saith our Lord: Upon three wickednesses of Gaza, &amp; upon four I will not convert it, because they have transported a perfect captivity, to shut it up in Idumea. And I will send fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the houses thereof. And I will destroy the inhabitant out of Azotus, &amp; him that holdeth the sceptre out of Ascalon: &amp; I will turn my hand upon Accaron, &amp; the rest of the Philisthiims shall perish, saith our Lord God. Thus saith our Lord: Upon the three wickednesses of Tyre, &amp; upon four I will not convert it: because they have shut up a perfect captivity in Idumea, &amp; have not remembered the league of brethren. And I will send fire upon the wall of Tyre, it shall devour the houses thereof. Thus saith our Lord: Upon three wickednesses of Edom, and upon four I will not convert him: because he hath persecuted his brother with the sword, and hath violated his mercy, &amp; hath held his fury longer, &amp; hath kept his indignation even to the end. I will send fire into Theman: and it shall devour the houses of Bosra. Thus saith our Lord: Upon three wickednesses of the children of Ammon, &amp; upon four I will not convert him: because he hath cut in sunder the women with child of Galaad to dilate his limit. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabba: and it shall devour the houses thereof with howling in the day of battle, and with a whirlwind in the day of commotion. And Melchom shall go into captivity, himself, and his princes together, saith our Lord.</div>
