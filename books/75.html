			<div class='roleText'>Speak to the children of Israel, that they take first fruits for me, of every man that offereth of his own accord, you shall take them. And these are the things which you must take: Gold, and silver, and brass, hyacinth and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and silk, and the hair of goats, and rams' skins dyed red, and janthine skins, and the wood setim; oil to make lights: spices for ointment, and for incense of good savour: Onyx stones, and precious stones to adorn the ephod, and rationale. And they shall make me a sanctuary, and I will dwell in the midst of them: according to all the similitude of the tabernacle which I will shew thee, &amp; of all the vessels to the service thereof: and thus you shall make it: Frame an ark of the wood setim, the length whereof shall have two cubits &amp; an half: the breadth, a cubit &amp; an half: the height, likewise a cubit &amp; an half. And thou shalt plate it with most pure gold within and without: and over it thou shalt make a golden crown round about: &amp; four golden rings, which thou shalt put at the four corners of the ark: let two rings be on the one side, &amp; two on the other. Thou shalt make bars also of the wood setim, &amp; shalt cover them with gold. And thou shalt put them in through the rings that are in the sides of the ark, that it may be carried on them: the which shall be always in the rings, neither shall they at any time be drawn out of them. And thou shalt put in the ark the testification which I will give thee. Thou shalt make a Propitiatory of most pure gold: the length thereof shall hold two cubits and an half, and the breadth a cubit &amp; an half. Two Cherubims also thou shalt make of beaten gold, on both sides of the oracle. Let one Cherub be on the one side, and the other on the other. Let them cover both sides of the Propitiatory spreading their wings, and covering the oracle, and let them look one towards the other, their faces turned unto the Propitiatory wherewith the ark is to be covered, wherein thou shalt put the testimony that I will give thee. Thence will I command, and will speak to thee over the propitiatory &amp; from the midst of the two Cherubims which shall be upon the ark of testimony, all things which I will command the children of Israel by thee. Thou shalt make a table also of the wood setim, having two cubits in length, and in breadth a cubit, &amp; in height a cubit and an half. And thou shalt plate it with most pure gold: and thou shalt make to it a golden ledge round about, and to the ledge itself a crown interpolished, four fingers high: and upon the same, another golden crown. Thou shalt prepare also four golden rings, and shalt put them in the four corners of the same table at every foot. Under the crown shall the golden rings be, that the bars may be put through them, and the table may be carried. The bars also themselves thou shalt make of the wood setim, &amp; shalt compass them with gold to bear up the table. Thou shalt prepare also saucers, and phials, censers, &amp; goblets, wherein the libaments are to be offered, of most pure gold. And thou shalt set upon the table loaves of proposition in my sight always. Thou shalt make also a candle stick beaten of most pure gold, the shaft thereof, &amp; branches, cups, and bowls, and lilies proceeding from the same. Six branches shall go forth of the sides, three out of one side, and three out of the other. Three cups as it were in manner of a nut on every branch, and bowl withal, and a lily: and three-cups likewise of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and a bowl withal, and a lily. This shall be the work of the six branches, that are to be drawn forth from the shaft: and in the candlestick itself shall be four cups in manner of a nut, and at every one bowls and lilies. Bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six coming forth out of one shaft. Both the bowls therefore and the branches shall be out of it, all the whole beaten of most pure gold. Thou shalt make also seven lamps, and shalt set them upon the candlestick, for to give light over-against. The snuffers also and where the snuffings shall be put out, let them be made of most pure gold. The whole weight of the candlestick with all the furniture thereof shall have a talent of most pure gold. Look, and make it according to the pattern, that was shewed thee in the mount.</div>
