The people shall dwell alone, and among the Gentiles shall not be accounted. Who may be able to number the dust of Jacob, and to know the number of the stock of Israel? My soul die the death of the just, and my last ends be made like to them. </div>

The Lord his God is with him, and the sound of the victory of the king in him. God hath brought him out of Aegypt, whose strength is like to the unicorn. There is no Soothsaying in Jacob, nor divination in Israel. In their times it shall be said to Jacob and Israel what God hath wrought. Behold the people shall rise up as a lioness and as a lion shall raise itself: It shall not lie down till it devour the prey, and drink the blood of the slain. </div>
