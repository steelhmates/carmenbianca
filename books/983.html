			<div class='roleText'>When I would heal Israel, the iniquity of Ephraim was revealed, &amp; the malice of Samaria, because they have wrought lying, &amp; the thief hath entered in spoiling, the robber without. And lest perhaps they may say in their hearts, that I have remembered all their malice: now have their own inventions compassed them, they have been done before me. In their malice they have rejoiced the king: and in their lies the princes. All they committing adultery, as it were an oven heated of the baker: the city was quiet a little from the commistion of leaven, till the whole was leavened. The day of our king, the princes began to rage by reason of wine: he stretched out his hand with the scorners. Because they have applied their heart as an oven, when he lay in wait for them: he slept all the night baking them, in the morning himself heated as a fire of flame. All were heated as an oven, and have devoured their judges: all their kings are fallen: there is none amongst them that cryeth unto me. Ephraim himself was mingled in the peoples: Ephraim is become as hearth-baken-bread that is not turned. Strangers have eaten his strength, &amp; he knew not: yea hoar hairs also were poured out on him, &amp; he was ignorant. And the pride of Israel shall be humbled in his face: neither did they return to the Lord their God, &amp; they have not sought him in all these. And Ephraim is become as a dove seduced, not having an heart: they invocated Aegypt, they went to the Assyrians. And when they shall go forth, I will spread my net upon them: as a fowl of the heaven will I pluck them down, I will beat them according to the hearing of their assembly. Woe to them, because they have revolted from me: they shall be wasted because they have prevaricated against me: &amp; I redeemed them &amp; they have spoken lies against me. And they have not cried to me in their heart, but they howled in their chambers: upon wheat and wine they chewed the cud, they are revolted from me. And I have taught them, and strengthened their arms: and against me they have thought malice. They returned, that they might be without yoke: they became as a deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword, for the fury of their tongue. This is their scorning in the Land of Aegypt.</div>
