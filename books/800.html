			<div class='roleText'>The burden of Moab. Because Ar-Moab was wasted in the night, he hath held his peace: because the wall of Moab is destroyed in the night, he hath held his peace. The house is gone up, &amp; Dibon to the high places to mourn upon Nabo, and upon Medaba shall Moab howl: on all the heads thereof baldness, and every beard shall be shaven. In the high ways thereof they are girded with sackcloth: upon the roofs thereof, and in the streets thereof all howling, goeth down to weep. Hesebon shall cry, &amp; Eleale, their voice is heard even to Jasa. For this shall the well appointed of Moab howl, his soul shall howl to himself. My heart shall cry to Moab, the bars thereof unto Segor an heifer astonishing: for by the ascent of Luith he shall go up weeping: &amp; in the way of Oronaim they shall lift up a cry of contrition. For the waters of Nemrim shall be made desolate, because the grass is withered, the spring is faded, all greenness is perished. According to the greatness of the work, is also their visitation: they shall lead them to the torrent of willows. Because the cry shall go round about the border of Moab: unto Gallim the howling thereof, and unto the Pit-Elim the cry thereof. Because the waters of Dibon are replenished with blood: for I will put additions upon Dibon: the lion for them that shall fly of Moab, and for the remnant of the land.</div>
