			<div class='roleText'>And Abias slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David: &amp; Asa his son reigned for him, in whose days the land was quiet ten years. And Asa did that which was good and pleasing in the sight of his God, &amp; he overthrew the altars of strange service, and the excelses, and brake the statues, and cut down the groves. And he commanded Juda that they should seek our Lord the God of their fathers, and should do the law, and all the commandments. And he took away out of all the cities of Juda the altars, &amp; temples, and reigned in peace. He built also fenced cities in Juda, because he was quiet, and there had no battles risen in his time, our Lord giving peace.

And Asa pursued them, &amp; the people that was with him, unto Gerara: &amp; the Aethiopians fell to utter destruction because our Lord killing them, and his army fighting, they were destroyed. They took therefore many spoils, and they struck all the cities round about Gerara: for great terror had invaded all men: and they spoiled the cities, and carried away much prey. Yea and destroying the sheepcotes of sheep, they took an infinite multitude of cattle, and of camels: and returned into Jerusalem.</div>
