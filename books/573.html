			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, in the inscription of the title to David himself, for doctrine, when he set fire on Mesopotamia of Syria, and in Sobal, and Joab returned, and struck Idumaea in the valley of salt-pits twelve thousand. O God thou hast repelled us, &amp; hast destroyed us: thou wast angry and hast had mercy on us. Thou hast moved the earth, and hast troubled it: heal the breaches thereof, because it is moved. Thou hast shewed unto thy people hard things: thou hast made us drink the wine of compunction. Thou hast given a signification to them that fear thee: that they fly from the face of the bow. That thy beloved may be delivered, save me with thy right hand, and hear me. God hath spoken in his holy: I shall rejoice, and shall divide Sichem: and shall measure the valley of tabernacles. Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim the strength of my head. Juda my king: Moab the pot of my hope. Into Edom I will stretch out my shoe: the foreigners are subject to me. Who shall conduct me into a fenced city? Who shall conduct me even into Idumea? Shall not thou, o God, that hast expelled us: and wilt not thou o God, go forth in our hosts? Give us aid from tribulation: because man's salvation is vain. In God we shall do strength: and he shall bring to nothing them that afflict us.</div>
