			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass, when Sanaballat had heard, and Tobias, and Gossem the Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, that I did build the wall, and there was no breach remaining in it (howbeit at that time I had not put the doors in the gates) Sanaballat and Gossem sent to me, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I am doing a great work, and I cannot go down, lest perhaps it be neglected when I shall come and descend to you. But they sent to me according to this word, four times: and I answered them according to the former word. And Sanaballat sent his servant to me the fifth time according to the former word, and he had a letter in his hand written in this manner: Among the Gentiles it is heard, and Gossem hath said, that thou and the Jews mean to rebel, and therefore thou buildest the wall, and will advance thyself king over them: for which cause, thou hast set up Prophets also, which should preach of thee in Jerusalem, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>It is not done according to these words, which thou speakest: for thou framest these things of thine own heart. For all these terrified us, thinking that our hands would cease from the work, and we would leave off. For which cause I did the more strengthen my hands: and I entered into the house of Samaia the son of Dalaia the son of Metabeel secretly, who said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let us consult with ourselves in the house of God in the midst of the temple: and Let us shut the doors of the temple, because they will come to kill thee, and in the night they will come to slay thee. And I said. Doth any man that is like unto me fly? And who being as I am, will go into the temple, and live? I will not go in. And I understood that God had not sent him, but as it were prophesying he had spoken to me, and Tobias, and Sanaballat had hired him. For he had taken a price, that I being terrified should do it, and sin, and they might have some evil to upbraid me withal. Remember me Lord for Tobias and Sanaballat, according to such their works. Yea and Noadias the Prophet, and the rest of the Prophets that terrified me. But the wall was finished the five and twentieth day of the month of Elul, in two and fifty days. It came to pass therefore when all our enemies had heard it, that all nations which were round about us, feared, and were dismayed within themselves, and knew that this work was done of God. But in those days also many letters of the principal Jews were sent to Tobias, and from Tobias there came to them. For there were many in Jury sworn unto him, because he was the son in law of Sechenias the son of Area, and Johanan his son had taken the daughter of Mosollam the son of Barachias. Yea and they praised him before me, and they reported my words unto him: and Tobias sent letters to terrify me.</div>
