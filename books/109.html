			<div class='roleText'>Speak to all the assembly of the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: Be ye holy, because I^ the Lord your God am holy. Let every one fear his father, and mother. Keep my Sabbaths. I^ the Lord your God. Turn not yourselves to idols, neither make you to yourselves molten gods. I^ the Lord your God. If ye immolate an host of pacifics to the Lord, that it may be placable, that day wherein it is immolated, shall you eat it, and the next day: and whatsoever shall be left until the third day, you shall burn with fire. If after two days any man eat thereof, he shall be profane, and guilty of impiety: and shall bear his iniquity, because he hath polluted the holy of the Lord, and that soul shall perish out of his people. And when thou reapest the corn of thy land, thou shalt not shear the face of the earth to the very ground: neither shalt thou gather the ears that remain. Neither in thy vineyard shalt thou gather the clusters and grapes that fall down, but shall leave them to the poor, and the strangers to take. I^ the Lord your God. You shall not commit theft. You shall not lie, neither shall any man deceive his neighbour. Thou shalt not forswear thyself in my name, nor pollute the name of thy God. I^ the Lord. Thou shalt not calumniate thy neighbour, nor oppress him by violence. The work of thy hireling shall not abide with thee until morning. Thou shalt not speak evil of the deaf man, nor put a stumbling block before the blind: but thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, because I am the Lord. Thou shalt not do that which is unjust, nor judge unjustly. Consider not the person of a poor man, neither honour thou the countenance of him that is mighty. Judge justly to thy neighbour. Thou shalt not be a criminator, nor a whisperer among the people. Thou shalt not stand against the blood of thy neighbour. I^ the Lord. Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but control him openly, lest thou incur sin through him. Seek not revenge, nor be mindful of the injury of thy citizens. Thou shalt love thy friend as thyself. I^ the Lord. Keep ye my laws. Thou shalt not make thy cattle to gender with the beasts of another kind. Thy field thou shalt not sow with diverse seed. A garment that is woven of two sorts, thou shalt not put on. If a man lie with a woman by carnal copulation, that is a bondwoman also marriable, &amp; yet not redeemed with a price, nor made free, both shall be beaten, and they shall not die, because she was not free. And for his offence he shall offer to the Lord, at the door of the tabernacle of testimony a ram: and the Priest shall pray for him, and for his sin before the Lord, and he shall become propitious to him again, and the sin shall be forgiven. When you shall be entered into the land, and have planted in it fruit trees, you shall take away the prepuces of them: the fruits that come forth shall be unclean to you, neither shall you eat of them. But in the fourth year, all their fruit shall be sanctified, laudable to the Lord. And the fifth year you shall eat the fruits, gathering the offspring that they bring forth. I^ the Lord your God. You shall not eat with blood. You shall not divine, nor observe dreams. Neither shall you cut your hair roundwise: nor shave your beard. And for the dead you shall not cut your flesh, neither shall you make in yourselves any figures or marks. I^ the Lord. Make not thy daughter a common strumpet, lest the land be contamined and filled with wickedness. Keep ye my Sabbaths, &amp; fear my Sanctuary. I^ the Lord. Decline not to magicians, neither ask any thing of soothsayers, to be polluted by them. I^ the Lord your God. Before the hoar head^ rise up, and honour the person of an old man: and fear the Lord thy God. I am the Lord. If a stranger dwell in your land, and abide among you, do not upbraid him: but let him be among you as the same country man: and you shall love him as yourselves: for you also have been strangers in the Land of Aegypt. I^ the Lord your God. Do not any unjust thing in judgment, in rule, in weight, or measure. Let the balance be just, and the weights equal, the bushel just, and the sextary equal. I^ the Lord your God, that brought you out of the Land of Aegypt. Keep all my precepts, and all my judgements, and do them. I^ the Lord.</div>
