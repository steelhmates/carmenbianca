			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Confess ye to our Lord because he is good: because his mercy is for ever. Confess ye to the God of gods: because his mercy is for ever. Confess ye to the Lord of lords: because his mercy is for ever Who only doth great marvels: because his mercy is for ever. Who made the heaven in understanding: because his mercy is for ever. Who established the earth over the waters: because his mercy is for ever. Who made the great lights: because his mercy is for ever. The sun to rule the day: because his mercy is for ever. The moon and stars to rule the night: because his mercy is for ever. Who struck Aegypt with their first-begotten: because his mercy is for ever. Who brought forth Israel out of the midst of them: because his mercy is for ever. In a mighty hand, and lofty arm: because his mercy is for ever. Who divided the Red sea into divisions: because his mercy is for ever. And brought forth Israel through the midst thereof: because his mercy is for ever. And he overthrew Pharao, and his host in the Red sea: because his mercy is for ever. Who led his people through the desert: because his mercy is for ever. Who struck great kings: because his mercy is for ever. And slew strong kings: because his mercy is for ever. Sehon the king of the Amorrheites: because his mercy is for ever. And Og the king of Basan: because his mercy is for ever: And he gave their land for an inheritance: because his mercy is for ever. For an inheritance to Israel his servant: because his mercy is for ever. For in our humiliation he was mindful of us: because his mercy is for ever. And he redeemed us from our enemies: because his mercy is for ever. Who giveth food to all flesh: because his mercy is for ever. Confess ye to the God of heaven: because his mercy is for ever. Confess ye to the Lord of lords: because his mercy is for ever.</div>
