			<div class='roleText'>And Judith said to all the people: Hear me brethren, hang ye this head upon our walls: and it shall be, when the sun shall rise, let every man take his armour, &amp; issue ye forth with violence, not that you go down beneath, but as it were invading violently. Then the watchmen must of necessity run to raise up their Prince to battle. And when the captains of them shall run to the tabernacle of Holofernes, and shall find him headless rolled in blood, fear will fall upon them. And when you shall know that they fly, go after them securely, because our Lord will destroy them under your feet. Then Achior seeing the power, that God of Israel wrought, forsaking the rite of gentility, believed God, and circumcised the flesh of his prepuce, and was joined to the people of Israel, and all the succession of his kindred until this present day. And immediately as day brake, they hung the head of Holofernes upon the walls, &amp; every man took his armour, &amp; they went forth with great noise &amp; shouting.

			<div class='roleText'>One Hebrew woman hath made confusion in the house of king Nabuchodonosor: for behold Holofernes lieth upon the ground and his head is not upon him. Which when the Princes of the power of the Assyrians had heard, they all rent their garments, &amp; intolerable fear and dread fell upon them, and their minds were troubled exceedingly. And there was made an incomparable cry in the midst of their camp.</div>
