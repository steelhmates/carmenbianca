			<div class='roleText'>As snow in the summer, and rain in the harvest: so is glory undecent for a fool. As a bird flying to other places, &amp; a sparrow going whither he lift: so a curse uttered in vain shall light upon some man. A whip for a horse, and a snaffle for an ass, and a rod on the back of the unwise. Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou be made like to him. Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he seem to himself to be wise. Lame of feet, and drinking iniquity, he that sendeth words by a foolish messenger. As a lame man hath fair legs in vain: so a parable is undecent in the mouth of fools. As he that casteth a stone into the heap of Mercury: so he that giveth honour to the unwise. As if a thorn should grow in the hand of the drunkard: so a parable in the mouth of fools. Judgement determineth causes: and he that putteth a fool to silence, appeaseth angers. As a dog that returneth to his vomit, so the unwise that reiterateth his folly. Hast thou seen a man seem to himself wise? The fool shall have hope rather than he. The slothful saith: A lion is in the way, and a lioness in the journeys: as a door turneth on his hinge so the slothful in his bed. The slothful hideth his hand under the arm-hole, and is grieved if he turneth it to his mouth. The slothful seemeth wiser to himself, than seven men speaking sentences. As he that taketh a dog by the ears, so he that passeth by impatient, and meddleth with another man's brawl. As he is hurtful that shooteth arrows and spears unto death: so a man that hurteth his friend fraudulently: and when he is taken withal saith: I did it in jest. When wood faileth, the fire shall be extinguished: and the whisperer taken away, brawls cease. As coals to burning coals, and wood to fire, so an angry man raiseth brawls. The words of the whisperer as it were simple, and the same come to the inmost parts of the belly. As if thou wouldest adorn an earthen vessel with drossy silver, so swelling lips joined with a most wicked heart. An enemy is perceived by his lips, when he shall handle deceits in his heart. When he shall submit his voice, believe him not: because there are seven mischiefs in his heart. He that covereth hatred fraudulently, his malice shall be revealed in the councel. He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that rolleth a stone, it shall return to him. A deceitful tongue loveth not truth, and a slipper mouth worketh ruins.</div>
