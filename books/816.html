			<div class='roleText'>Woe to them that go down into Aegypt for help, hoping in horses, and having confidence upon chariots, because they be many: and upon horsemen, because they be very strong: and have not trusted upon the holy one of Israel, &amp; have not sought after our Lord. But he that is the wise one hath brought evil, and hath not taken away his words: &amp; he will rise up against the house of the wicked, and against the aid of them that work iniquity. Aegypt, a man, and not God: and their horses, flesh, and not spirit: and our Lord shall bow down his hand, and the helper shall fall, and he that is holpen shall fall, and they shall all be confounded together. Because thus saith our Lord to me: As if a lion should roar, and the lion's whelp upon his prey, and when a multitude of shepherds shall come against him, he will not fear at their voice, and of their multitude he will not be afraid: so shall the Lord of hosts descend to fight upon mount Sion, and upon the little hill thereof. As birds that fly, so will the Lord of hosts protect Jerusalem, protecting and delivering, passing and saving. Return as you revolted deeply, o children of Israel. For in that day man shall cast away the idols of his silver, and the idols of his gold, which your hands have made you into sin. And Assur shall fall by the sword not of man, and the sword not of man shall devour him, and he shall fly not at the face of the sword: &amp; his young men shall be tributaries: and his strength shall pass away at the terror, &amp; his princes flying shall be afraid: our Lord hath said it: whose fire is in Sion, &amp; his furnace in Jerusalem.</div>
