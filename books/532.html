			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, the Psalm of David. The heavens shew forth the glory of God, and the firmament declareth the works of his hands. Day unto day uttereth word: and night unto night sheweth knowledge. There are no languages, nor speeches, whose voices are not heard. Their sound hath gone forth into all the earth; and unto the ends of the round world the words of them. He put his tabernacle in the sun: &amp; himself as a bridegroom coming forth of his bride-chamber. He hath rejoiced as a giant to run the way, his coming forth from the top of heaven: And his recourse even to the top thereof: neither is there that can hide himself from his heat. The law of our Lord is immaculate converting souls: the testimony of our Lord is faithful, giving wisdom to little ones. The justices of our Lord be right, making hearts joyful: the precept of our Lord lightsome, illuminating the eyes. The fear of our Lord is holy, permanent for ever and ever: the judgments of our Lord be true, justified in themselves. To be desired above gold and much precious stone: and more sweet above honey and the honey-comb. For thy servant keepeth them, in keeping them is much reward. Sins who understandeth? From my secret sins cleanse me: and from other mens spare thy servant. If they shall not have dominion over me, then shall I be immaculate; and shall be cleansed from the greatest sin. And the words of my mouth shall be such as may please: and the meditation of my heart in thy sight always. O Lord my helper and my Redeemer.</div>
