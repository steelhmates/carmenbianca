			<div class='roleText'>And in the six and thirtieth year of his reign, came up Baasa the king of Israel into Juda, and with a wall compassed Rama, that none could safely go out and come in of the Kingdom of Asa. Asa therefore brought forth silver and gold, out of the treasures house of our Lord, and of the king's treasures, and he sent to Benadad the king of Syria, who dwelt in Damascus, saying: There is league between me and thee, my father also &amp; thy father had concord, wherefore I have sent thee silver and gold that breaking the league, which thou hast with Baasa the king of Israel, thou make him retire from me. Which being known, Benadad sent the Princes of his hosts to the cities of Israel: who struck Ahion, and Dan, and Ablemaim, and all the walled cities of Nephthali. Which when Baasa had heard, he ceased to build Rama, &amp; intermitted his work. Moreover Asa the king took all Juda, and carried away the stones out of Rama, and the timber that Baasa had prepared for the building: &amp; he built of them Gabaa, &amp; Maspha. At that time came Hanani the Prophet to Asa the king of Juda, &amp; said to him: Because thou hast had confidence in the king of Syria, and not in our Lord thy God, therefore hath the army of the king of Syria escaped out of thy hand. Were not the Aethiopians, and Libyans, many more in chariots and horsemen, and a multitude exceeding great: whom, when thou didst believe in our Lord, he delivered into thy hand? For the eyes of our Lord behold all the earth, and give strength to them, that with perfect heart believe in him. Thou therefore hast done foolishly, and for this cause from this present time shall battles arise against thee. And Asa being angry against the Seer, commanded him to be cast into fetters: for he took indignation exceedingly upon this thing: &amp; he slew of the people at that time very many. But the works of Asa the first &amp; the last are written in the Book of the kings of Juda and Israel. Asa also fell sick in the nine and thirtieth year of his reign, of a most vehement pain of his feet, and neither in his infirmity did he seek our Lord, but rather trusted in the art of Physicians. And he slept with his fathers: and he died the one and fortieth year of his reign. And they buried him in his sepulchre, which he had digged for himself in the City of David: and they laid him upon his bed full of spices and odoriferous ointments, which were made by the art of apothecaries, and they burnt over him with exceeding ambition.</div>
