And hearing these things we greatly feared, and our heart fainted, neither did there remain spirit in us at your entering in: for the Lord your God he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath. Now therefore swear to me by the Lord, that as I have done mercy with you, so you also do with my father's house: and you give me a true sign, that you save my father and mother, my brethren and sisters, and all things that be theirs, and deliver our souls from death. </div>
