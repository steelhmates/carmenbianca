			<div class='roleText'>AND it came to pass afterward, and he made his journey by cities and towns preaching and evangelizing the Kingdom of God; and the Twelve with him, and some women that had been cured of wicked spirits and infirmities; Mary which is called Magdalene, out of whom seven devils were gone forth, And Joane the wife of Chusa^ Herod's procurator, and Susan, and many others that did minister unto him of their substance. And when a very great multitude assembled and hastened out of the cities unto him, he said by a similitude. The sower went forth to sow his seed. And whiles he soweth, some fell by the way side, and was trodden upon, and the fowls of the air did eat it. And other some fell upon the rock; and being shot up, it withered, because it had not moisture. And othersome fell among thorns, and the thorns growing up withal, choked it. And other some fell upon good ground; and being shot up, yielded fruit an hundred fold. Saying these things he cried: He that hath ears to hear, let him hear. And his Disciples asked him what this parable was. To whom he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>To you it is given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to the rest in parables, that seeing they may not see, and hearing may not understand. And the parable is this: The seed, is the word of God. And they besides the way, are those that hear, then the devil cometh, and taketh the word out of their heart, lest believing they be saved. For they upon the rock; such as when they hear, with joy receive the word: and these have no roots; because for a time they believe, and in time of tentation they revolt. And that which fell into thorns, are they that have heard, and going their ways, are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and render not fruit. And that upon good ground, are they which in a good and very good heart, hearing the word, do retain it, and yield fruit in patience. And no man lighting a candle doth cover it with a vessel, or put it under a bed; but setteth it upon a candlestick, that they that enter in, may see the light. For there is not any thing secret, that shall not be made manifest; nor hid, that shall not be known, &amp; come abroad. See therefore how you hear. For he that hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, that also which he thinketh he hath, shall be taken away from him. And his mother and brethren came unto him; and they could not come at him for the multitude. And it was told him: Thy mother and thy brethren stand without, desirous to see thee. Who answering said to them: My mother and my brethren, are they that hear the word of God and do it. And it came to pass one day; and he went up into a boat, and his Disciples, and he said to them: Let us strike over the lake. And they launched forth. And when they were sailing, he slept; and there fell a storm of wind into the lake, and they were filled, and were in danger. And they came and raised him, saying: </div>

And when he was come forth to the land, there met him a certain man that had a devil now a very long time, and he did wear no cloths, neither did he tarry in house, but in the monuments. And as he saw JESUS, he fell down before him; and crying out with a great voice, he said: </div>

For many times he caught him, and he was bound with chains, and kept with fetters; and breaking the bonds was driven of the devil into the deserts. And JESUS asked him saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Legion, because many devils were entered into him. And they besought him that he would not command them to go into the depth. And there was there a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain; &amp; they desired him that he would permit them to enter into them. And he permitted them. The devils therefore went forth out of the man, and entered into the swine; and the herd with violence went headlong into the lake, and was stifled. Which when the swineherds saw done, they fled, and told into the city and into the towns. And they went forth to see that which was done; and they came to JESUS, and found the man, out of whom the devils were gone forth, sitting at his feet, clothed, and well in his wits, and they were afraid. And they also that had seen, told them how he had been made whole from the legion. And all the multitude of the country of the Gerasens besought him to depart from them; for they were taken with great fear. And he going up into the boat, returned. And the man out of whom the devils were departed, desired him that he might be with him. But JESUS dismissed him, saying: Return into thy house, and tell how great things God hath done to thee. And he went through the whole city, preaching how great things JESUS had done to him. And it came to pass; when JESUS was returned, the multitude received him. And all were expecting him. And behold there came a man whose name was Jairus, and he was Prince of the Synagogue: and he fell at the feet of JESUS, desiring him that he would enter into his house, because he had an only daughter almost twelve years old, and she was a dying. And it chanced, whiles he went, he was thronged of the multitudes. And there was a certain woman in a flux of blood from twelve years past, which had bestowed all her substance upon Physicians, neither could she be cured of any: she came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment; and forthwith the flux of her blood stinted, And JESUS said: </div>

And the woman seeing, that she was not hid, came trembling, and fell down before his feet; and for what cause she had touched him, she shewed before all the people, and how forthwith she was made whole. But he said to her: Daughter, thy faith hath made thee safe, go thy way in peace. As he was speaking, there cometh one to the Prince of the Synagogue, saying to him, That thy daughter is dead, trouble him not. And JESUS hearing this word, answered the father of the maid: Fear not; believe only, and she shall be safe. And when he was come to the house, he permitted not any man to enter in with him, but Peter, and James, and John, and the father and mother of the maid. And all wept, and mourned for her.
