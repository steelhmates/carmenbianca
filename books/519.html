			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for her that obtaineth the inheritance. The Psalm of David. Receive, o Lord my words with thine ears, understand my cry. Attend to the voice of my prayer, my King and my God. Because I will pray to thee: Lord in the morning thou wilt hear my voice. In the morning I will stand by thee and will see: because thou art not a God that wilt iniquity. Neither shall the malignant dwell near thee: neither shall the unjust abide before thine eyes. Thou hatest all that work iniquity: thou wilt destroy all that speak lie. The bloody and deceitful man our Lord will abhor: But I in the multitude of thy mercy. I will enter into thy house: I will adore toward thy holy temple in thy fear. Lord conduct me in thy justice: because of mine enemies direct my way in thy sight. Because there is no truth in their mouth: their heart is vain. Their throat is an open sepulchre, they did deceitfully with their tongues, judge them o God. Let them fail of their cogitations, according to the multitude of their impieties expel them, because they have provoked thee o Lord. And let all be glad, that hope in thee, they shall rejoice for ever: and thou shalt dwell in them. And all that love thy name shall glory in thee, because thou wilt bless the just. Lord, as with a shield of thy good will, thou hast crowned us.</div>
