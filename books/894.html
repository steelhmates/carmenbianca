			<div class='roleText'>Go not into Aegypt, to dwell there. But Baruch the son of Nerias doth provoke thee against us, that he may deliver us into the hands of the Chaldees, that he may kill us, and make us to be transported into Babylon. And Johanan the son of Caree, and all the Princes of the men of war, &amp; the whole people, heard not the voice of our Lord, to abide in the Land of Juda. But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the Princes of the men of war taking all the remnant of Juda, that were returned out of all nations, to which they had before been dispersed, to dwell in the Land of Juda: men and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every soul, which Nabuzardan the Prince of the war had left with Godolias the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, and Jeremy the Prophet, and Baruch the son of Nerias. And they went into the Land of Aegypt, because they obeyed not the voice of our Lord: &amp; they came as far as Taphnis. And the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy in Taphnis, saying: Take thee great stones in thy hand, and thou shalt hide them in the cave, that is under the brick wall in the gate of Pharao's house in Taphnis: in the sight of the men of Juda. And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will send, and take to me Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon my servant: and I will set his throne over these stones, which I have hid, and he shall set his throne upon them. And coming he shall strike the Land of Aegypt: those that into death, into death: &amp; those that into captivity, into captivity: and those that into the sword, into the sword. And he shall kindle a fire in the temples of the gods of Aegypt, and shall burn the same, and he shall lead them captive: &amp; he shall be clothed with the Land of Aegypt, as a pastor is clothed with his cloak: &amp; he shall go out from thence in peace. And he shall break the statues of the house of the Sun, that are in the Land of Aegypt: and the temples of the gods of Aegypt he shall burn with fire.</div>
