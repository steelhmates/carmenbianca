			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, a Psalm to David himself. Blessed is the man that understandeth concerning the needy, and the poor: in the evil day our Lord will deliver him. Our Lord preserve him, and give him life, and make him blessed in the land: and deliver him not unto the will of his enemies. Our Lord help him upon the bed of his sorrow: thou hast turned all his couch in his infirmity. I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lord have mercy on me: heal my soul, because I have sinned to thee. Mine enemies have spoken evils to me: When shall he die and his name perish? And if he came in to see, he spake vain things: his heart hath gathered together iniquity to himself. He went forth, and spake together. All mine enemies whispered against me: they did think evils to me. They have determined an unjust word against me: shall not he that sleepeth add to rise again? For the man also of my peace, in whom I hoped: who did eat my breads, hath greatly trodden me under-foot. But thou, o Lord, have mercy upon me, and raise me up again: and I will repay them. In this I have known that thou wouldest me: because mine enemy shall not rejoice over me. But me thou hast received because of innocency: and thou hast confirmed me in thy sight for ever. Blessed be our Lord the God of Israel from the beginning of the world, and for evermore: Be it, be it.</div>
