			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of Canticle, in the sabbath day. It is good to confess to our Lord: and to sing to thy name, o Highest. To shew forth thy mercy in the morning: and thy truth in the night. In the instrument of ten strings, in Psalter: with Canticle, on the Harp. Because thou hast delighted me, o Lord, in thy workmanship: and in the works of thy hands I will rejoice. How are thy works magnified, o Lord! Thy cogitations are made very profound. The unwise man will not know; and the fool will not understand these things. When sinners shall spring up as grass: and all that work iniquity shall appear. That they may perish for ever: but thou the Highest for ever, o Lord. Because lo thine enemies, o Lord, because lo thine enemies shall perish: and all that work iniquity shall be dispersed. And my horn shall be exalted, as the unicorn's: and my old age in plentiful mercy. And mine eye hath looked upon mine enemies: and the malignant rising up against me, mine ears shall hear. The just shall flourish as a palm tree: as the cedar of Libanus shall he be multiplied. They that are planted in the house of our Lord, shall flourish in the courts of the house of our God. As yet shall they be multiplied in plentiful old age: and they shall be well affected, that they may shew forth: That the Lord our God is righteous, and there is no iniquity in him.</div>
