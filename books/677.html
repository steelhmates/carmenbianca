			<div class='roleText'>A wise son is the doctrine of the father: but he that is a scorner, heareth not when he is rebuked. Of the fruit of his own mouth man shall be filled with good things: but the soul of the prevaricators is wicked. He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his soul: but he that is unadvised to speak shall feel evils. The sluggard will and will not: but the soul of them that work, shall be made fat. The just shall detest a lying word: but the impious confoundeth, and shall be confounded. Justice keepeth the way of the innocent: but impiety supplanteth the sinner. There is one as it were with riches whereas he hath nothing: and there is as it were poor, whereas he is in much riches. The redemption of a man's life, his riches: but he that is poor, beareth not reprehension. The light of the just maketh glad: but the candle of the impious shall be extinguished. Among the proud there are always brawls: but they that do all things with counsel, are ruled by wisdom. Substance hastened shall be diminished: but that which by little and little is gathered with the hand, shall be multiplied. Hope that is deferred afflicteth the soul: a tree of life the desire of ckoning. Who so detracteth from any thing, he bindeth himself for the time to come: but he that feareth the precept, shall converse in peace. Guileful souls err in sins: the just are merciful &amp; have pity. The law of a wise man a fountain of life, that he may decline from the ruin of death. Good doctrine shall give grace: in the way of contemners a whirlpool. The subtle man doth all things with counsel: but he that is a fool openeth folly. The messenger of the impious shall fall into evil: but a faithful legate, is health. Poverty, and ignominy, to him that forsaketh discipline: but he that yieldeth to him that rebuketh, shall be glorified. Desire if it be accomplished, delighteth the soul: fools detest them that fly evil things. He that walketh with the wise, shall be wise: a friend of fools shall be made like. Evil pursueth sinners, and to the just good things shall be repayed. The good man leaveth heirs, sons, and nephews: and the substance of the sinner is kept for the just. Much meat in the tilled grounds of the fathers: and to others they are gathered without judgment. He that spareth the rod, hateth his child: but he that loveth him doth instantly nurture him. The just eateth and filleth his soul: but the belly of the impious unsatiable.</div>
