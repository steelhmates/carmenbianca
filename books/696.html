			<div class='roleText'>The words of Ecclesiastes, the son of David, king of Jerusalem. Vanity of vanities, said Ecclesiastes: vanity of vanities, and all things are vanity. What hath a man more of all his labour, whereby he laboureth under the sun? Generation passeth, and generation cometh: but the earth standeth for ever. The sun riseth, and goeth down, and returneth to his place: and there rising again, compasseth by the South, and bendeth to the North: compassing all things, goeth forward in circuit, &amp; returneth unto his circles. All rivers enter into the sea, and the sea overfloweth not: to the place, whence the rivers issue forth, they do return, that they may flow again.

			<div class='roleText'>Lo I have been made great, and have gone beyond all in wisdom, that were before me in Jerusalem: and my mind hath contemplated many things wisely, and I have learned. And I have given my heart to know prudence, and doctrine, and errors, and folly: and I have perceived that in these also there was labour, and affliction of spirit, for that in much wisdom there is much indignation: and he that addeth knowledge, addeth also labour.</div>
