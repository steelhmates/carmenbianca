			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, the Psalm of David. Lord in thy power the king shall be glad: and upon thy salvation he shall rejoice exceedingly. The desire of his heart thou hast given him: and of the will of his lips thou hast not defrauded him. Because thou hast prevented him in blessings of sweetness, thou hast put on his head a crown of precious stone. He asked life of thee: and thou gavest him length of days for ever, and for ever and ever. Great is his glory in thy salvation: glory and great beauty thou shalt put upon him. Because thou shalt give him to be a blessing for ever and ever: thou shalt make him joyful in gladness with thy countenance. Because the king hopeth in our Lord: and in the mercy of the Highest he shall not be moved. Let thy hand be found of all thy enemies: let thy right hand find all that hate thee. Thou shalt put them as an oven of fire in the time of thy countenance: our Lord in his wrath shall trouble them, and fire shall devour them. Their fruit thou shalt destroy from the land: and their seed from the children of men. Because they have turned the evils upon thee: they have devised counsels, which they could not establish. Because thou shalt put them back: in thy remnants thou shalt prepare their countenance. Be exalted Lord in thy power: we will chant and sing thy powers.</div>
