			<div class='roleText'>And after that he began to be ninety and nine years old, our Lord appeared unto him, and said unto him: I am the God almighty: walk before me, and be perfect. And I will make my covenant between me and thee: and I will multiply thee exceedingly. Abram fell flat on his face. And God said to him: I am, and my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be a father of many Nations. Neither shall thy name be called any more Abram; but thou shalt be called Abraham: because a father of many Nations I have made thee. And I will make thee increase exceedingly, and I will make thee into Nations, and kings shall come forth of thee. And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and between thy seed after thee in their generations by a perpetual covenant: to be thy God, and thy seeds after thee. And I will give to thee, and to thy seed the land of thy peregrination, all the land of Chanaan for a perpetual possession, and I will be their God. Again God said to Abraham: And thou therefore shalt keep my covenant, and thy seed after thee in their generations. This is my covenant which you shall observe between me and you, and thy seed after thee: All the male kind of you shall be circumcised: and you shall circumcise the flesh of your prepuce, that it may be for a sign of the covenant between me and you. An infant of eight days shall be circumcised among you, all male-kind in your generations: as well the homebred shall be circumcised, as the bought servant of whosoever he is, not of your stock: and my covenant shall be in your flesh for a perpetual covenant. The male, whose flesh of his prepuce shall not be circumcised, that soul shall be destroyed out of his people: because he hath broken my covenant. God said also to Abraham: Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call Sarai, but Sara. And I will bless her, and of her I will give thee a son, whom I will bless, and he shall be into Nations, and kings of peoples shall spring of him. Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, saying in his heart: Shall trowest thou to him that is an hundred year old a son be born? And Sara that is ninety years old shall she bear? And he said to God: I would that Ismael may live before thee. And God said to Abraham: Sara thy wife shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Isaac, and I will establish my covenant to him for a perpetual covenant, and to his seed after him. Concerning Ismael also I have heard thee. Behold, I will bless him, and increase and multiply him exceedingly: twelve Dukes shall he beget, and I will make him into a great Nation. But my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sara shall bring forth to thee at this time another year. And when he had left off speaking with him, God ascended from Abraham. And Abraham took Ismael his son, and all the homebred of his house: and all whom he had bought, all the males of all the men of his house: and he circumcised the flesh of their prepuce forthwith the very same day, as God had commanded him. Abraham was ninety and nine years old, when he circumcised the flesh of his prepuce. And Ismael his son was full thirteen years old at the time of his circumcision. The self-same day was Abraham circumcised and Ismael his son. And all the men of his house, as well the homebred as the bought servants and strangers were circumcised together.</div>
