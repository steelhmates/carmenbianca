			<div class='roleText'>I am this day an hundred and twenty years old, I cannot go out &amp; come in any longer, especially whereas our Lord also hath said to me: Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan: Our Lord therefore thy God will pass over before thee: he will destroy all these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possess them: and this Josue shall pass over before thee, as our Lord hath spoken. And our Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings of the Ammorrheites, and to their land, and shall destroy them. Therefore when our Lord shall have delivered these also to you, you shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded you. Do manfully, &amp; be strengthened: fear not, neither tremble ye at their sight: because our Lord thy God himself is thy conductor, &amp; will not leave nor forsake thee. </div>

And my fury shall be wrath against them in that day, &amp; I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured: all evils and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall say in that day: In truth because God is not with me, these evils have found me. But I will hide, and keep close my face in that day, for all the evils which they have done, because they have followed strange gods. Now therefore write unto you this canticle, &amp; teach the children of Israel: that they know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, &amp; this song be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel. For I will bring them into the Land, for the which I sware to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey: And when they have eaten, and are full, and fat, they will turn away to strange gods, and serve them: and will detract from me, and make my covenant of none effect. After that many evils and afflictions shall have found them, this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed. For I know their cogitations, what things they are about to do this day, before that I bring them into the Land which I have promised them. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of our Lord your God: that it may be for a testimony against thee. For I know thy contention, and thy most stiff neck. Whiles I yet live and go in with you, you have done always contentiously against our Lord: how much more when I shall be dead? Gather to me all the ancients by your tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will invocate against them heaven and earth. For I know that after my death you will do wickedly, and will decline quickly from the way, that I have commanded you: and evils shall come upon you in the later times, when you shall do evil in the sight of our Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands. Moyses therefore spake in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel the words of this song, and finished it even to the end.</div>
