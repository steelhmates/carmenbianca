The waters have compassed me even to the soul: the depth hath inclosed me, the sea hath covered my head.

When my soul was in distress within me, I remembered our Lord: that my prayer may come to thee unto thy holy temple. They that keep vanities in vain, forsake their mercy. But I in the voice of praise will immolate to thee: what things soever I have vowed I will render for salvation to our Lord. And our Lord spake to the fish: and it vomited up Jonas upon the dry land.</div>
