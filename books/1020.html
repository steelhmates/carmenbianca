			<div class='roleText'>The prayer of Habacuc the prophet for ignorances. Lord I heard thy hearing, and was afraid. Lord thy work in the midst of years, quicken it: In the midst of years shalt thou make it known: when thou art angry, thou wilt remember mercy. God will come from the South, and the holy one from mount Pharan: His glory shall cover the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise. His brightness shall be as the light, horns in his hands: There is his strength hid. Before his face shall death go, and the devil shall go forth before his feet. He stood and measured the earth, he beheld, and dissolved the Gentiles: and the mountains of the world were broken. The hills of the world were bowed, by the ways of his eternity. For iniquity I saw the tents of Aethiopia, the skins of the land of Madian shall be troubled. Why, wast thou angry with the rivers o Lord? Or was thy fury in the rivers? Or thine indignation in the sea? Who wilt mount upon thy horses, and thy chariots salvation. Raising thou wilt raise up thy bow: the oath to the tribes which thou hast spoken. Thou wilt cut the rivers of the earth. The mountains saw thee, and were sorry, the gulf of water passed. The depth gave his voice: the height lifted up his hands. The sun and the moon stood in their habitation, in the light of thine arrows, they shall go in the brightness of thy glittering spear. In fretting thou wilt tread down the earth: in fury thou wilt astonish the Gentiles. Thou wentest forth the salvation of thy people: salvation with thy Christ. Thou struckest the head out of the house of the impious, thou hast discovered the foundation even to the neck. Thou hast cursed his sceptres, the head of his warriors, them that come as a whirlwind to disperse me. Their exultation, as his that devoureth the poor in secret. Thou madest a way in the sea for thy horses, in the midst of many waters. I heard, and my belly was troubled: at the voice my lips trembled. Let rottenness enter in my bones, and swarm under me. That I may rest in the day of tribulation: that I may ascend to our girded people. For the fig-tree shall not flourish: &amp; there shall be no spring in the vines. The work of the olive-tree shall deceive: and the fields shall not yield meat: the cattle shall be cut off from the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls. But I will joy in our Lord: and will rejoice in God my JESUS. God our Lord is my strength: and he will make my feet as of the harts': and upon my high places he the conquerer will lead me singing in psalms.</div>
