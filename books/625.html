			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Of the return of Aggeus and Zachary. Blessed is the man that feareth our Lord: he shall have great delight in his commandments. His seed shall be mighty in the earth: the generation of the righteous shall be blessed. Glory and riches in his house: and his justice abideth for ever and ever. Light is risen up in darkness to the righteous: he is merciful, and pitiful, and just. Acceptable is the man, that is merciful and lendeth, that shall dispose his words in judgment: Because he shall not be moved for ever. The just shall be in eternal memory: he shall not fear at the hearing of evil. His heart is ready to hope in our Lord, his heart is confirmed: he shall not be moved till he look over his enemies. He distributed, he gave to the poor: his justice remaineth for ever and ever, his horn shall be exalted in glory. The sinner shall see, and will be angry, he shall gnash his teeth and pine away: the desire of sinners shall perish.</div>
