			<div class='roleText'>But Job answering, said: Whose helper are thou? His that is weak? And doest thou hold up the arm of him, that is not strong? To whom hast thou given counsel? Perhaps to him, that hath not wisdom, and thy prudence hast thou shewed very great. Whom wouldest thou teach? Not him that made breath? Behold the giants groan under the waters, &amp; they that dwell with them. Hell is naked before him, &amp; there is no covert to perdition. Who stretcheth out the north-wind over the vacant, and hangeth the earth upon nothing. Who bindeth the waters in his clouds, that they break not forth together downward. Who holdeth the countenance of his throne, &amp; spreadeth his cloud over it. He hath made a limit about the waters, till light and darkness be ended. The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at his beck. In his strength suddenly the seas are gathered together, and with his wisdom he struck the proud man. His spirit hath adorned the heavens &amp; his hand being the mid-wife, the winding serpent is brought forth. Lo, these things are said in part of his ways: and where as we have heard scarce a little drop of his word, who shall be able to behold the thunder of his greatness?</div>
