			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, in praises, a Psalm to Asaph, a Canticle to the Assyrians. God is known in Jewry: in Israel his name is great. And his place is made in peace; and his habitation in Sion. There he brake the powers of bows, the shield, the sword, and the battle. Thou doest illuminate marvelously from the eternal mountains: all the foolish of heart were troubled. They slept their sleep: and all the men of riches found nothing in their hands. At thy reprehension, o God of Jacob, they have all slumbered that mounted on horses. Thou art terrible, and who shall resist thee? From that time thy wrath. From heaven thou hast made thy judgment heard: the earth trembled and was quiet. When God arose unto judgment, that he might save all the meek of the earth. Because the cogitation of man shall confess to thee: and the remains of the cogitation shall keep festival day to thee. Vow ye and render to our Lord your God: all ye that round about him bring gifts. To the terrible, and him that taketh away the spirit of Princes, terrible to the kings of the earth.</div>
