			<div class='roleText'>Thou shalt see it with thine eyes, and shalt not eat thereof. There were therefore four men lepers, beside the entrance of the gate: who said one to another: What mean we to be here till we die? Whether we enter into the city, we shall die for famine: or whether we tarry here, die we must: come therefore, &amp; let us run away to the camp of Syria. If they spare us, we shall live: but if they will kill us, we shall die nevertheless. They arose therefore in the evening, to come to the camp of Syria. And when they were come to the beginning of the camp of Syria, they found no man there. For our Lord had made them in the camp of Syria to hear the sound of chariots, &amp; horses, &amp; of a very great army: &amp; they said one to another: Behold the king of Israel hath for wages hired against us the kings of the Hetheites, &amp; of the Aegyptians, &amp; they are come upon us. They arose therefore, &amp; fled in the dark, &amp; left their tents, and their horses and asses in the camp, and fled desirous to save their lives only. Therefore when these lepers were come to the beginning of the camp, they entered into one tabernacle, and did eat and drink: and they took thence silver, and gold, and raiment, and went, and hid it: again they returned to another tabernacle, and from thence likewise taking away they hid it. And they said one to another: We do not well: for this is a day of good tidings. If we shall hold our peace, and will not tell until morning, we shall be blamed of a heinous offence: Come, let us go, and make report in the king's court. And when they were come to the gate of the city, they told them saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>We went to the camp of Syria, and found no man there, but horses, and asses tied, and the tents pitched. The porters therefore went, and told it to the king within his palace. Who arose in the night, and said to his servants: I tell you what the Syrians have done to us: They know that we suffer great famine, and therefore they are gone out of the camp and lie hid in the fields, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>When they shall come forth out of the city, we will take them alive, and then we may enter into the city. But one of his servants answered: Let us take five horses that are remaining in the city (because they only are in the whole multitude of Israel for the other are consumed) and sending, we may try. They brought therefore two horses, and the king sent into the camp of the Syrians, saying, Go ye, and see. Who went after them as far as Jordan: and behold all the way was full of raiment, and vessels, which the Syrians had cast away, when they were amazed, and the messengers returning told the king. And the people going forth spoiled the camp of Syria: &amp; a bushel of floor became at one stater, and two bushels of barley at one stater, according to the word of our Lord. Moreover the king appointed that Duke on whose hand he leaned, to stand at the gate: whom the multitude trod in the entrance of the gate, and he died, according as the man of God had spoken, when the king came down to him. And it came to pass according to the word of the man of God, which he spake to the king, when he said: </div>
