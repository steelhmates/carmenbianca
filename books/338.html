			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, came Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, himself and all his army unto Jerusalem, and they beset it: and built rampires round about it. And the city was shut up &amp; trenched about until the eleventh year of king Sedecias, the ninth day of the month: and there was a sore famine in the city, neither was there bread for the people of the land. And a breach was made into the city: and all the men of war fled in the night by the way of the gate, which is between the double wall toward the king's garden (moreover the Chaldees besieged the city round about.) Sedecias therefore fled by the way, that leadeth to the champion of the wilderness. And the army of the Chaldees pursued the king, and overtook him in the plain of Jericho: and all the warriors, that were with him, were dispersed, and forsook him. They therefore having taken the king, brought him to the king of Babylon into Reblatha, who spake judgment with him. And he slew the sons of Sedecias before his face, and he put out his eyes, and bound him with chains, and brought him into Babylon. The fifth month, the seventh day of the month, that is, the nineteenth year of the king of Babylon, came Nabuzardan the General of the army, the servant of the king of Babylon into Jerusalem. And he burnt the house of our Lord, the king's house, and the houses of Jerusalem, and every house he burnt with fire. And all the army of the Chaldees, which was with the General of the soldiers, destroyed the walls of Jerusalem round about. And Nabuzardan the General of the army, transported the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and the fugitives, that were fled to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the common people. And of the poor of the land he left dressers of vineyards and husbandmen. And the brazen pillars, that were in the temple of our Lord, and the feet, and the sea of brass, which was in the house of our Lord, the Chaldees brake, and transported all the brass into Babylon. The pots also of brass, and mazers, and forks with three teeth, and cups, and little mortars, and all the vessels of brass, in the which they ministered, they took away. Moreover also the censers, and phials: those that were of gold: and that were of silver, the General of the warfare took, that is, two pillars, one sea, and the feet which Salomon had made in the temple of our Lord: there was no weight of the brass of all the vessels. One pillar had eighteen cubits in height: and the little head of brass upon it was three cubits in height: and the net, and the pomegranates upon the little head of the pillar, all of brass: the second also had the like adorning. Also the general of the army took Saraias the chief Priest, and Sophonias the second Priest, and three porters. And of the city one Eunuch, which was captain over the men of war: and five men of them that waited before the king, whom he found in the city, and Sopher the captain of the army, who proved the young soldiers of the people of the land: and threescore men of the common people, which were found in the city. Whom Nabuzardan the General of the army taking, brought them to the king of Babylon into Reblatha. And the king of Babylon struck them, and slew them in Reblatha in the land of Emath: and Juda was transported out of their land. And he made Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan Governor over the people, that was left in the land of Juda, which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had left. Which when all the captains of the soldiers had heard, they and the men that were with them, to wit, that the king of Babylon had appointed Godolias, there came to Godolias into Maspha Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Johanan the son of Caree, and Saraia the son of Thanehumeth a Netophathite, and Jezonias the son of Maachathi, they and their fellows. And Godolias sware to them and to their companions, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Be not afraid to serve the Chaldees: tarry in the country, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. But it came to pass in the seventh month, there came Ismahel the son of Nathanias, the son of Elisama of the king's seed, and ten men with him: and struck Godolias, who also died: yea the Jews also and the Chaldees, that were with him in Maspha. And all the people rising up from little to great, and the captains of the soldiers, came into Aegypt fearing the Chaldees. But it came to pass in the seven &amp; thirtieth year of the Transmigration of Joachin the king of Juda, in the twelfth month, the seven and twentieth day of the month: Evilmerodach the king of Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head of Joachin the king of Juda out of prison. And he spake unto him courteously: and he set his throne above the throne of the kings, that were with him in Babylon. And he changed his garments, which he had in the prison, and he did eat bread always in his sight, all the days of his life. A certain provision also he appointed for him without intermission, which was also given him of the king day by day, all the days of his life.</div>
