			<div class='roleText'>And our Lord said to me: Yet again go, love a woman beloved of her friend, and an adulteress; as our Lord loveth the children of Israel, and they have respect to strange gods, and love the kernels of grapes. And I digged her unto me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for a core of barley, and for half a core of barley. And I said to her: Thou shalt expect me many days: thou shalt not fornicate, and thou shalt be no man's: but I also will expect thee. Because many days shall the children of Israel sit without king, and without prince, and without sacrifice, and without altar, and without ephod, and without theraphim. And after this the children of Israel shall return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king: and they shall dread at the Lord, and at his goodness in the last days.</div>
