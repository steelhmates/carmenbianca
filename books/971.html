			<div class='roleText'>IN the first year of Darius the son of Assuerus of the seed of the Medes, who reigned over the kingdom of the Chaldees: the first year of his kingdom, I^ Daniel understood in books the number of years, whereof the word of our Lord was made to Jeremie the prophet, that seventy years should be accomplished of the desolation of Jerusalem. And I set my face to our Lord my God to pray and beseech in fastings, sackcloth, and ashes. And I prayed our Lord my God, and I confessed, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I beseech thee o Lord God great and terrible, which keepest covenant, &amp; mercy to them that love thee, and keep thy commandments. We have sinned, we have done iniquity, we have dealt impiously, and have revolted: &amp; we have declined from thy commandments, and judgements. We have not obeyed thy servants the prophets, that have spoken in thy name to our kings, to our princes, to our fathers, and to all the people of the land. To thee o Lord, justice: but to us confusion of face, as is today to the man of Juda, and to the inhabiters of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, to them that are near, and to them that are far off in all the lands, to which thou hast cast them out, for their iniquities in which they have sinned against thee. O Lord, to us confusion of face, to our princes, &amp; to our fathers that have sinned. But to thee Lord our God mercy and propitiation, because we have revolted from thee: and have not heard the voice of the Lord our God, to walk in his law, which he gave us by his servants the prophets. And all Israel have transgressed thy law, and have declined from hearing thy voice, and the malediction hath distilled upon us, &amp; the detestation, which is written in the book of Moyses the servant of God, because we have sinned to him. And he hath established his words, which he spake upon us, and upon our princes, that judged us, that he would bring in upon us a great evil, such as never was under all the heaven, according to that which hath been done in Jerusalem. As it is written in the law of Moyses, all this evil is come upon us: and we besought not thy face o Lord our God, that we might return from our iniquities, &amp; might think on thy truth. And our Lord hath watched upon the malice, and hath brought it upon us: just is the Lord our God in all his works, which he hath done: for we have not heard his voice. And now o Lord our God, which broughtest forth thy people out of the Land of Aegypt in a strong hand, &amp; madest thee a name according to this day: we have sinned, we have done iniquity. O Lord according to all thy justice, but let thy wrath be turned away I beseech thee, and thy fury from thy city Jerusalem, &amp; from thy holy mount. For by reason of our sins, and the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem, and thy people are a reproach to all round about us. Now therefore hear o our God the petition of thy servant, &amp; his prayers: and shew thy face upon thy sanctuary, which is desert, for thine own sake. Incline^ my God^ thine ear, &amp; hear: open thine eyes, and see our desolation, &amp; the city upon which thy name is invocated: for neither in our justifications do we prostrate prayers before thy face, but in thy many commiserations. Hear o Lord, be pacified o Lord: attend &amp; do, delay not for thine own sake my God: because thy name is invocated upon thy city, &amp; upon thy people. And when I yet spake, &amp; prayed, and confessed my sins, and the sins of my people of Israel, and did prostrate my prayers in the sight of my God, for the holy mount of my God: as I was yet speaking in prayer, lo the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision from the beginning, quickly flying touched me in the time of the evening sacrifice. And he taught me, and spake to me, &amp; said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Daniel now am I come forth to teach thee, and that thou mightest understand. From the beginning of thy prayers the word came forth: and I am come to shew it to thee, because thou art a man of desires: and do thou mark the word, and understand the vision. Seventy weeks are abridged upon thy people, &amp; upon thy holy city, that prevarication may be consummate, and sin take an end, &amp; iniquity be abolished; and everlasting justice be brought; &amp; vision be accomplished, and prophecy; &amp; the Holy one of holies be anointed. Know therefore, &amp; mark: From the going forth of the word, that Jerusalem be built again, unto Christ the prince, there shall be seven weeks, &amp; sixty two weeks, &amp; the street shall be built again, &amp; the walls in straitness of the times. And after sixty two weeks Christ shall be slain: and it shall not be his people, that shall deny him. And the city, &amp; the sanctuary shall the people dissipate with the prince to come: &amp; the end thereof waste, &amp; after the end of the battle the appointed desolation. And he will confirm the covenant to many, one week: and in the half of the week shall the host &amp; the sacrifice fail: and there shall be in the temple the abomination of desolation: &amp; even to the consummation, and to the end shall the desolation endure.</div>
