			<div class='roleText'>The Psalm of David, in the consummation of the tabernacle. Bring to our Lord ye children of God: bring to our Lord the sons of rams. Bring to our Lord glory and honour, bring to our Lord glory unto his name: adore ye our Lord in his holy court. The voice of our Lord upon waters, the God of majesty hath thundered: Our Lord upon many waters. The voice of our Lord in power: the voice of our Lord in magnificence. The voice of our Lord breaking cedars: and our Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus: And he shall break them in pieces as a calf of Libanus. And the beloved as the son of unicorns. The voice of our Lord dividing the flame of fire. The voice of our Lord shaking the desert, and our Lord shall move the desert of Cades. The voice of our Lord preparing harts, and he shall discover thick woods: and in his temple all shall say glory. Our Lord maketh to inhabit the flood: and our Lord shall sit King for ever. Our Lord will give strength to his people: our Lord will bless his people in peace.</div>
