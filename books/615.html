			<div class='roleText'>The prayer of the poor, when he shall be anxious, and shall make his petition before our Lord. Lord hear my prayer: and let my cry come to thee. Turn not away thy face from me: in what day soever I am in tribulation, incline thine ear to me. In what day soever I shall invocate thee, hear me speedily. Because my days have vanished as smoke: and my bones are withered as a dry burnt firebrand. I am strucken as grass, and my heart is withered: because I have forgotten to eat my bread. For the voice of my groaning, my bone hath cleaved to my flesh. I am become like a pelican of the wilderness: I am become as a night crow in the house. I have watched, and am become as a sparrow solitary in the house-top. All the day did mine enemies upbraid me: and they that praised me sware against me. Because I did eat ashes as bread, &amp; mingled my drink with weeping. At the face of thy wrath and indignation: because lifting me up thou hast thrown me down. My days have declined as a shadow: and I am withered as grass. But thou o Lord endurest for ever: and thy memorial in generation and generation. Thou rising up shalt have mercy on Sion: because it is time to have mercy on it, because the time cometh. Because the stones thereof have pleased thy servants: and they shall have pity on the earth thereof. And the Gentiles shall fear thy name o Lord, and all the kings of the earth thy glory. Because our Lord hath built Sion: and he shall be seen in his glory. He hath had respect to the prayer of the humble: and he hath not despised their petition. Let these things be written unto another generation: and the people that shall be created shall praise our Lord. Because he hath looked forth from his high holy place: our Lord from heaven hath looked upon the earth. That he might hear the groanings of the fettered: that he might loose the children of them that are slain: That they may shew forth the name of our Lord in Sion: and his praise in Jerusalem. In the assembling of the people together in one, and kings to serve our Lord. He answered him in the way of his strength: Shew me the fewness of my days. Call me not back in the half of my days: thy years are unto generation and generation. In the beginning, o Lord, thou didst found the earth: and the heavens are the works of thy hands. They shall perish, but thou art permanent: and they shall all wax old as a garment. And as a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be changed: but thou art the self-same, and thy years shall not fail. The children of thy servants shall inhabit: and their seed shall be directed for ever.</div>
