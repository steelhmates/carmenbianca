			<div class='roleText'>But the queen of Saba also having heard the fame of Salomon, in the name of our Lord came to prove him in hard propositions. And entering into Jerusalem with a great train, and riches, and camels carrying spices, and gold exceeding infinite, and precious stones, she came to king Salomon, and spake to him all things that she had in her heart. And Salomon interpreted to her all the words, that she proposed: there was not a word, that the king could be ignorant of, and could not answer her. And the queen of Saba seeing all the wisdom of Salomon, and the house which he had built, and the meats of his table, and the habitations of his servants, and the orders of them that served, and their garments, cup-bearers, and the holocausts which he offered in the house of our Lord: she had no longer spirit, and she said to the king: The report is true, which I have heard in my country, concerning thy words, and concerning thy wisdom, and I did not believe them that told me, till myself came, and saw with mine eyes, &amp; have proved that the half hath not been told me: greater is thy wisdom, and thy works, than the rumour, which I have heard. Blessed are thy men, and blessed are thy servants, which stand before thee always, and hear thy wisdom. Be the Lord thy God blessed, whom thou hast pleased, and that hath set thee upon the throne of Israel, for that the Lord hath loved Israel for ever, and hath appointed thee king, to do judgment and justice. She therefore gave to the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold, and spices exceeding much, and precious stones: There was no more brought so much spice, as that which the queen of Saba gave to king Salomon. (But the navy also of Hiram, which carried gold out of Ophir, brought from Ophir thyine trees exceeding many, and precious stones. And the king made of the thyine trees the porches of the house of our Lord, and of the king's house, and harps &amp; vials for the singers: there were not such thyine trees brought, nor seen until this present day. And king Salomon gave to the queen of Saba all that she would, and asked of him: beside those things, which of himself he offered her for a royal gift. Who returned, and went into her country with her servants. And the weight of the gold, that was brought to Salomon every year, was of six hundred sixty six talents of gold: beside that, which the men brought, that were over the tributes, and merchants, and all that sold light wares, and all the kings of Arabia, and the Dukes of the land. Salomon also made two hundred shields of most pure gold, six hundred sicles of gold did he allow for the plates of one shield. And three hundred targets of tried gold: and three hundred pounds of gold garnished one target: and the king put them in the house of the forest of Libanus. King Salomon also made a great throne of ivory: and covered it with gold exceeding yellow, which had six steps: and the top of the throne was round in the hinder part: and two hands on either side holding the seat: and two lions stood at every hand. And twelve little lions standing upon the six steps on either side: there was not such a work made in all Kingdoms. Yea and all the vessels, out of the which king Salomon drunk, were of gold: and all the furniture of the house of the forest of Libanus of most pure gold: there was no silver, neither was it thought of any price in the days of Salomon, because the king's navy, once in three years, went with the navy of Hiram on the sea into Tharsis, bringing thence gold, &amp; silver, &amp; the teeth of elephants, and apes, &amp; peacocks. King Salomon therefore was magnified above all the kings of the earth in riches, &amp; wisdom. And all the earth desired to see Salomon's face, that they might hear his wisdom, which God had given in his heart. And every one presented him gifts, vessels of silver and gold, garments, and instruments for war, spices also, and horses, and mules every year. And Salomon gathered together the chariots and horsemen, and there amounted to him a thousand four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen: and he disposed them in fenced cities, and with the king in Jerusalem. And he made that there was as great aboundance of silver in Jerusalem, as of stones: and of cedar trees he caused such a multitude, as if it were sycamore trees, which grow in the plains. And there were horses brought for Salomon out of Aegypt, and Coa, for the king's merchants bought them out of Coa, and brought them at a set price. And a chariot of four horses came out of Aegypt, for six hundred sicles of silver, and one horse for an hundred and fifty. And after this manner did all the kings of the Hetheites, and of Syria sell horses.</div>
