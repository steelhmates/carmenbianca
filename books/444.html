They therefore at this exhortation of his, beseeching our Lord, continued in the sight of our Lord, so that they also which offered the holocausts to our Lord, did offer the sacrifices to our Lord girded with hair-cloths, and there were ashes upon their head. And they all prayed God with all their heart, that he would visit his people Israel.</div>
