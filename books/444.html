			<div class='roleText'>Then the children of Israel, which dwelt in the Land of Juda, hearing these things, were sore afraid of his presence. Trembling also, &amp; horror invaded their senses, lest he would do that to Jerusalem and to the temple of our Lord, which he had done to other cities, &amp; their temples. And they sent into all Samaria round about, as far as Jericho, and preoccupated all the tops of mountains: and they compassed their towns with walls, and gathered together corn for provision of battle. Eliachim the Priest wrote to all, that were against Esdrelon, which is against the face of the great field beside Dothain, and to all, by whom there might be passage of way, that they should take the ascents of the mountains, by which there might be way to Jerusalem, and should keep watch, where the way was narrow between the mountains.

They therefore at this exhortation of his, beseeching our Lord, continued in the sight of our Lord, so that they also which offered the holocausts to our Lord, did offer the sacrifices to our Lord girded with hair-cloths, and there were ashes upon their head. And they all prayed God with all their heart, that he would visit his people Israel.</div>
