			<div class='roleText'>Hear the word, that our Lord hath spoken upon you, ye children of Israel: upon all the kindred that I brought forth out of the Land of Aegypt, saying: Only you have I known of all the kindreds of the earth: therefore will I visit upon you all your iniquities. Why shall two walk together, unless they be agreed? Will the lion roar in the forest, unless he have a prey? Will the lion's whelp give voice out of his den, unless he hath caught somewhat? Will the bird fall into the snare of the earth, without the fowler? Shall the snare be taken away from the earth, before it hath taken somewhat? Shall the trumpet sound in the city, and will not the people be afraid? Shall there be evil in the city, which our Lord hath not done? Because our Lord God will not do a word, unless he have revealed his secret to his servants the Prophets. The lion shall roar, who will not fear? Our Lord God hath spoken, who shall not prophesy? Make it heard in the houses of Azotus, and in the houses of the Land of Aegypt, and say: Gather ye together upon the mountains of the Samaria, and see the many madnesses in the midst thereof, and them that suffer calumny in the inner parts thereof. And they have not known to do right, saith our Lord, treasuring up iniquity, and robberies in their houses. Therefore thus saith our Lord God: The land shall be in tribulation, &amp; compassed about, and thy strength shall be plucked away from thee, and thy houses shall be spoiled. Thus saith our Lord: As if a Pastor should get out of the lion's mouth two legs, or the tip of the ear: so shall the children of Israel, that dwell in Samaria, be delivered, in the plague of the bed, and in the couch of Damascus. Hear ye, and contest in the house of Jacob, saith our Lord the God of hosts: That in the day when I shall begin to visit the prevarications of Israel, I will visit upon him, and upon the altars of Bethel: and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and shall fall to the ground. And I will strike the winter house with the summer house: and the houses of ivory shall perish, and many houses shall be dissipated, saith our Lord.</div>
