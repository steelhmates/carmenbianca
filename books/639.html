			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. When our Lord turned the captivity of Sion: we were made as men comforted. Then was our mouth replenished with joy: and our tongue with exultation. Then shall they say among the Gentiles: Our Lord hath done magnifically with them. Our Lord hath done magnifically with us: we are made joyful. Turn our captivity, o Lord, as a torrent in the South. They that sow in tears, shall reap in joyfulness. Going they went and wept, casting their seeds. But coming they shall come with exultation, carrying their sheaves.</div>
