			<div class='roleText'>Remember o Lord what is fallen to us: behold, and regard our reproach. Our inheritance is turned to aliens: our houses to strangers. We are made pupils without father: our mothers are as it were widows. Our water we have drunk for money: our wood we have bought for a price. We were led by our necks, no rest was given to the weary. We have given our hand to Aegypt, and to the Assyrians, that we might be filled with bread. Our fathers have sinned, &amp; they are not: and we have borne their iniquities. Servants have ruled over us: there was none that would redeem us out of their hand. In peril of our lives did we fetch us bread, at the face of the sword in the desert. Our skin was burnt as an oven, by reason of the tempests of famine. They humbled the women in Sion, and the virgins in the cities of Juda. The Princes were hanged up by the hand: they did not reverence the faces of the ancients. Young men they abused unchastely: and the children fell in wood. The ancients decayed out of the gates: the youngmen out of the choir of the singers. The joy of our heart hath failed, our choir is turned into mourning. The crown of our head is fallen: woe to us, because we have sinned. Therefore is our heart made sorrowful, therefore are our eyes darkened. For mount Sion, because it is perished, foxes have walked on it. But thou o Lord shalt remain for ever, thy throne in generation and to generation. Why wilt thou for ever be forgetful of us? Wilt thou forsake us in length of days? Convert us o Lord to thee, and we shall be converted: renew our days, as from the beginning. But rejecting thou hast rejected us, thou art angry against us exceedingly.</div>
