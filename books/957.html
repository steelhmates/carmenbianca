			<div class='roleText'>And he brought me to the gate that looked to the way of the East. And behold the glory of the God of Israel went by the East gate: and he had a voice as the voice of many waters, and the earth shined at his majesty. And I saw a vision according to the form which I had seen, when he came to destroy the city: and the shape according to the sight, which I had seen by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face. And the majesty of our Lord went into the temple by the way of the gate that looked to the East. And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the inner court: and behold the house was filled with the glory of our Lord. And I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and a man stood by me, said to me: Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the steps of my feet, where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever: and the house of Israel shall no more pollute my holy name, they, and their kings in their fornications, and in the ruins of their kings, and in the excelses. Who have built their threshold by my threshold, and their posts by my posts: and there was a wall between me and them: and they polluted my holy name in the abominations which they did: for the which thing I consumed them in my wrath. Now therefore let them repel their fornication, &amp; ruins of their kings far from me: &amp; I will dwell in the midst of them always. But thou son of man, shew to the house of Israel the temple, and let them be confounded at their iniquities, and let them measure the frame: and be ashamed of all things that they have done. The figure of the house, &amp; of the frame thereof, the goings out, and the comings in, and all the description thereof, and all the precepts thereof, and all the order thereof, and all the laws thereof shew to them, and thou shalt write in their eyes: that they may keep all the descriptions thereof, and the precepts thereof, and let them do them. This is the law of the house in the top of the mount: All the border thereof round about is holy of holies: this then is the law of the house. And these are the measures of the altar by the most true cubit, which had a cubit and a palm: in the bosom thereof was a cubit, &amp; a cubit in breadth: and the limit thereof even to the brim thereof, and round about, one palm: this also was the trench of the altar. And from the bosom of the ground to the lowest brim two cubits, and the breadth of one cubit: and from the lesser brim unto the greater brim four cubits, and the breadth of one cubit. And Ariel it-self of four cubits: &amp; from Ariel upward four horns. And Ariel of twelve cubits in length by twelve cubits of breadth, four square with equal sides. And the brim of fourteen cubits of length by fourteen cubits of breadth in the four corners thereof: &amp; the crown round about it of half a cubit, &amp; the bosom thereof of one cubit round about: and the steps thereof turned to the East. And he said to me: Son of man, thus saith our Lord God: These are the rites of the altar, in what day soever it shall be made: that holocaust may be offered upon it, and blood poured out. And thou shalt give to the Priests, and Levites, that are of the seed of Sadoc, that approach to me, saith our Lord God, that they offer to me a calf of the herd for sin. And taking of his blood, thou shalt put it upon the four horns thereof, and upon the four corners of the brim, and upon the crown round about: and thou shalt cleanse, and expiate it. And thou shalt take the calf, that is offered for sin: and thou shalt burn him in a separate place of the house without the sanctuary. And in the second day thou shalt offer a buck of goats unspotted for sin: and they shall expiate the altar, as they did expiate in the calf. And when thou shalt have accomplished expiating it, thou shalt offer a calf of the herd unspotted, and a ram of the flock unspotted. And thou shalt offer them in the sight of our Lord: and the Priests shall cast salt upon them, &amp; shall offer them an holocaust to our Lord. Seven days shalt thou make a buck goat for sin daily: and a calf of the herd, &amp; a ram of the cattle unspotted shall they offer. Seven days shall they expiate the altar, and shall cleanse it: and they shall fill his hand. And the days being expired, in the eighth day and so forth, the priests shall make your holocausts upon the altar, and those which they offer for peace: and I will be pacified toward you, saith our Lord God.</div>
