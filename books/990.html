			<div class='roleText'>Let Samaria perish, because she hath stirred up her God to bitterness: let them perish by the sword, let their little ones be dashed, and let the women with child be cut in sunder. Convert o Israel to our Lord thy God: because thou art fallen in thine iniquity. Take words with you, and convert to our Lord, and say to him: Take away all iniquity, and receive good: and we will render the calves of our lips. Assur shall not save us, we will not mount upon horse: neither will we say any more: Our gods the work of our hands: because thou wilt have mercy on the pupil, which is in thee. I will heal their confractions, I will love them voluntarily: because my fury is averted from them. I will be as dew, Israel shall spring as the lily, and his root shall break forth as that of Libanus. His boughs shall go, and his glory shall be as the olive-tree: and his smell as of Libanus. They shall be converted that sit under his shadow: they shall live with wheat, and they shall spring as a vine: his memorial as the wine of Libanus. Ephraim, what have I to do any more with idols? I will hear, and I will direct him as a verdant fir-tree: out of me thy fruit is found. Who is wise, and shall understand these things? Of understanding, and shall know these things? Because the ways of our Lord be right, and the just shall walk in them: but prevaricators shall fall in them.</div>
