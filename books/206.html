			<div class='roleText'>And the second lot came forth of the children of Simeon by their kindreds: and their inheritance was in the midst of the possession of the children of Judas: Bersabee and Sabee and Molada, and Hasersual, Bala and Asem, and Eltholad, Bethul and Harma, and Siceleg and Betmarchaboth and Hasersusa, and Bethlebaoth &amp; Sarohen: thirteen cities, and their towns: Ain and Remmon and Athor and Asan: four cities, and their towns: all the little towns round about these cities unto Baalath Beer Ramath against the south quarter. This is the inheritance of the children of Simeon according to their kindreds, in the possession and cord of the children of Judas: because it was greater. And therefore the children of Simeon possessed in the midst of their inheritance. And the third lot fell of the children of Zabulon by their kindreds: and the border of their possession was made as far as Sarid. And it went up from the sea and Merala, and came into Debbaseth: as far as the torrent, which is against Ieconam. And it returneth from Sared against the East into the ends of Ceseleth thabor: and it goeth out to Dabereth, and riseth up against Iaphie. And thence it passeth along to the east side of Geth hepher and Thacasim: and goeth out into Remmon, Amthar and Noa. And it compasseth to the North of Hanathon: &amp; the issues thereof are the valley Iephtahel, &amp; Cateth &amp; Naalol &amp; Semeron &amp; Ierala &amp; Bethlehem: twelve cities, &amp; their towns. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Zabulon by their kindreds, the cities and their little towns. The fourth lot came forth to Issachar by their kindreds. And his inheritance was Jezrael and Casaloth and Sunem, and Hapharaim and Sehon, and Anaharath and Rabboth &amp; Cesion, Abes, &amp; Rameth, and Engannim, and Enhadda and Bethpheses. And the border thereof cometh to Thabor &amp; Sehesema and Bethsames: and their issues were Jordan: sixteen cities, and their towns. This is the possession of Issachar by their kindreds, the cities, and their little towns. And the fifth lot fell to the tribe of the children of Aser by their kindreds: and their border was Halcath and Chali and Beten and Axaph, and Elmelec and Amaad and Messal: and it reacheth to Carmel of the sea and Sihor and Labanath. And it returneth against the east of Bethdagon: and passeth along to Zabulon and the Valley Iephthael against the North into Bethemec and Nehiel. And it goeth out to the left side of Cabul, and Abran and Rohob and Hamon and Cana, as far as great Sidon. And it returneth into Horma unto the very well fenced city Tyre, &amp; unto Hosa: and the issues thereof shall be into the sea from the cord of Achziba: and Amma and Aphec &amp; Rohob, cities twenty two, and their towns. This is the possession of the children of Aser by their kindreds, and the cities and their towns. Of the sons of Nephthali fell the sixth lot by their families: and the border began from Heleph and Elon into Saanaim, and Adami, which is Neceb, and Iebnael unto Lecum: and their issues unto Jordan: and the border returneth against the West into Azanotthabor, and thence goeth out into Hucuca, and passeth along into Zabulon against the South, and into Azer against the West, and into Juda unto Jordan against the rising of the sun. cities very well fenced, Assedim, Ser, and Emath, and Reccath and Cenereth, and Edema and Arama, Asor, and Cedes and Edrai, Enhasor and Ieron and Magdalel, Horem and Bethanath and Bethsames: nineteen cities and their towns. This is the possession of the tribe of the children of Nephthali by their kindreds, the cities and their towns. To the tribe of the children of Dan by their families came forth the seventh lot: and the border of their possession was Sara and Esthaol, &amp; Hirsemes, that is the city of the sun. Selebin &amp; Aialon and Iethela, Elon and Themna and Acron, Elthece, Gebbethon and Balaath, and Jud and Bane and Barac and Gethremmon: and Meiarcon &amp; Arecon, with the border that looketh toward Joppe, and is shut up with the same end. And the children of Dan went up, &amp; fought against Lesem, and they took it: and they struck it in the edge of the sword, and possessed, and dwelt in it, calling the name of it Lesem Dan, by the name of Dan the father thereof. This is the possession of the tribe of the sons of Dan, by their kindreds, the cities and their towns: And when he had made an end of dividing the Land by lot to every one by their tribes, the children of Israel gave possession to Josue the son of Nun in the midst of them, according to the commandment of our Lord, the city which he requested, Thamnath Saraa in mount Ephraim: and he built the city, and dwelt in it. These are the possessions, which Eleazar the Priest, and Josue the son of Nun, and the Princes of the families and of the tribes of the children of Israel, divided by lot in Silo, before our Lord at the door of the tabernacle of testimony, and they parted the Land.</div>
