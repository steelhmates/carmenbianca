			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. O Jerusalem praise our Lord: praise thy God, o Sion. Because he hath strengthened the locks of thy gates: he hath blessed thy children in thee. Who hath set thy borders peace: and filleth thee with the fat of corn. Who sendeth forth his speech to the earth: his word runneth swiftly. Who giveth snow as wool: scattereth mist as ashes. He casteth his crystal as morsels: before the face of his cold who shall endure? He shall send forth his word, and shall melt them: his spirit shall blow, and waters shall flow. Who declareth his word to Jacob: his justices and judgments to Israel. He hath not done in like manner to any nation: and his judgements he hath not made manifest to them. Alleluia.</div>
