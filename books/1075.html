And Jacob begat Judas and his brethren: And Judas begat Phares and Zaram of Thamar. And Phares begat Esron. And Esron begat Aram. And Aram begat Aminadab. And Aminadab begat Naasson.

For he shall save his people from their sins. And all this was done that it might be fulfilled which our Lord spake by the Prophet saying. Behold a Virgin shall be with child, &amp; bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us. And Joseph rising up from sleep, did as the Angel of our Lord commanded him, &amp; took his wife. And he knew her not till she brought forth her first born Son: &amp; called his name JESUS.</div>
