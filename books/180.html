And when you are passed over Jordan into the land, which our Lord thy God will give thee, thou shalt erect great stones, and shalt polish them with plaster. that thou mayst write on them all the words of this law, when thou hast passed over Jordan: that thou mayst enter into the Land, which our Lord thy God will give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, as he sware to thy fathers. When therefore you are passed Jordan, erect the stones, which I command you this day, in mount Hebal, and thou shalt polish them with plaster: and thou shalt build there an altar to our Lord thy God^ of stones, which iron hath not touched, and of stones not fashioned nor polished: and thou shalt put upon it holocausts to our Lord thy God, and shalt immolate pacific hosts, and eat there, and feast before our Lord thy God. And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law plainly and clearly. </div>

Cursed be he that maketh the blind to go amiss in his journey. And all the people shall say: Amen. Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger, of the pupil and the widow. And all the people shall say: Amen. Cursed be he that sleepeth with his father's wife, and revealeth the cover of his bed. And all the people shall say: Amen. Cursed be he that lieth with any beast. And all the people shall say: Amen. Cursed be he that sleepeth with his sister, the daughter of his father, or of his mother. And all the people shall say: Amen.
