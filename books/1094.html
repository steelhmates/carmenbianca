			<div class='roleText'>THE Kingdom of Heaven is like to a man that is an householder which went forth early in the morning to hire workmen into his vineyard. And having made covenant with the workmen for a penny a day, he sent them into his vineyard. And going forth about the third hour, he saw other standing in the market place idle, and he said to them: Go you also into the vineyard, and that which shall be just, I will give you. And they went their way. And again he went forth about the sixth &amp; the ninth hour: and did likewise. But about the eleventh hour he went forth and found other standing, &amp; he saith to them: What stand you here all the day idle? They say to him: Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them: Go you also into the vineyard. And when evening was come, the Lord of the vineyard saith to his bailiff, Call the workmen, and pay them their hire, beginning from the last even to the first. Therefore when they were come that came about the eleventh hour, they received every one a penny. But when the first also came, they thought that they should receive more: and they also received every one a penny. And receiving it they murmured against the good-man of the house. Saying: These last have continued one hour, and thou hast made them equal to us that have borne the burden of the day &amp; the heats. But he answering said to one of them, Friend, I do thee no wrong: didst thou not covenant with me for a penny? Take that is thine, and go: I will also give to this last even as to thee also. Or, is it not lawful for me to do that I will? Is thine eye naught, because I am good? So shall the last be first, and the first, last. For many be called, but few elect. And JESUS going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve Disciples secretly, and said to them: Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief Priests and to the Scribes, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles to be mocked, and scourged, and crucified, and the third day he shall rise again. Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zebedee with her sons, adoring and desiring something of him. Who said to her: What wilt thou? She saith to him: Say that these my two sons may sit, one at thy right hand, &amp; one at thy left hand in thy Kingdom. And JESUS answering, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>You know not what you desire. Can you drink of the cup that I shall drink of? They say to him: We can. He saith to them: My cup indeed you shall drink of: but to sit at my right hand and left, is not mine to give to you: but to whom it is prepared of my Father. And the ten hearing it, were displeased at the two brethren. And JESUS calleth them unto him, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>You know that the princes of the Gentiles overrule them: and they that are the greater, exercise power against them. It shall not be so among you, but whosoever will be the greater among you, let him be your minister: And he that will be first among you, shall be your servant. Even as the Son of man is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many. And when they went out from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. And behold two blind men sitting by the way side, heard that JESUS passed by, and they cried out saying: </div>
