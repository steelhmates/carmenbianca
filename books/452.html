And his servants brought her into the tabernacle, which he had commanded. And whilst she went in, she desired that she might have licence to go forth in the night and before day to prayer, &amp; to beseech our Lord. And he commanded his chamberlains, that as it pleased her, she should go out &amp; come in to adore her God for three days. And she went forth in the nights into the vale of Bethulia, &amp; washed herself in a fountain of water.

And whatsoever shall please him, that shall be best to me all the days of my life. And she arose, and decked herself with her garments, and going in she stood before his face. And the heart of Holofernes was strucken: for he burnt in the concupiscence of her. And Holofernes said to her: Drink now, &amp; sit down in joyfulness, because thou hast found grace before me.
