			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, the Psalm of David. Our Lord hear thee in the day of tribulation: the name of the God of Jacob protect thee. Send he aid to thee from the holy place: and from Sion defend he thee. Be he mindful of all thy sacrifice: and be thy holocaust made fat. Give he unto thee according to thy heart: and confirm he all thy counsel. We shall rejoice in thy salvation: and in the name of our God we shall be magnified. Our Lord accomplish all thy petitions: now have I known that our Lord hath saved his CHRIST. He shall hear him from his holy heaven: the salvation of his right hand is in powers. These in chariots, and these in horses: but we will invocate in the name of the Lord our God. They are bound, &amp; have fallen: but we have risen &amp; are set upright. Lord save the king, and hear us in the day, that we shall invocate thee</div>
