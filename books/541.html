			<div class='roleText'>A psalm to David himself. To thee, o Lord, I will cry, my God keep not silence from me: lest at any time thou hold thy peace from me, &amp; I shall be like to them that go down into the lake. Hear, o Lord, the voice of my petition whilst I pray to thee: whilst I lift up my hands to thy holy temple. Draw me not together with sinners: and with them that work iniquity destroy me not. Which speak peace with their neighbour, but evils in their hearts. Give them according to their works, &amp; according to the wickedness of their inventions. According to the works of their hands give unto them: render them their retribution. Because they have not understood the works of our Lord, and in the works of his hands thou shalt destroy them, &amp; not build them up. blessed be our Lord: because he hath heard the voice of my petition. Our Lord is my helper, and my protector: in him my heart hath hoped, and I was holpen. And my flesh flourished again: &amp; with my will I will confess to him. Our Lord is the strength of his people: and he is the protector of the salvations of his anointed. Save thy people, o Lord, and bless thine inheritance: and rule them, and extol them for ever.</div>
