			<div class='roleText'>AND the Apostles and brethren that were in Jewry, heard that the Gentiles also received the word of God. And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the Circumcision reasoned against him, saying: Why didst thou enter in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them? But Peter began and declared to them the order, saying: I was in the city of Joppe praying, &amp; I saw in an excess of mind a vision, a certain vessel descending as it were a great sheet with four corners let down from heaven, &amp; it came even unto me. Into which I looking considered, &amp; saw four footed beasts of the earth, &amp; cattle, &amp; such as creep, &amp; fowls of the air. And I heard also a voice saying to me: Arise Peter, kill and eat. And I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Not so Lord; for common or unclean thing never entered into my mouth. And a voice answered the second time from heaven: That which God hath made clean, do not thou call common. And this was done thrice: and all were taken up again into heaven. And behold, three men immediately were come to the house wherein I was, sent to me from Caesarea. And the spirit said to me, that I should go with them, doubting nothing. And there came with me these six brethren also: and we went into the man's house. And he told us, how he had seen an Angel in his house, standing and saying to him: Send to Joppe, and call hither Simon, that is surnamed Peter, who shall speak to thee words wherein thou shalt be saved and all thy house. And when I had begun to speak, the Holy Ghost fell upon them, as upon us also in the beginning. And I remembered the word of our Lord, according as he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost. If therefore God hath given them the same grace, as to us also that believed in our Lord JESUS CHRIST: who was I that might prohibit God? Having heard these things, they held their peace: &amp; glorified God, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>God then to the Gentiles also hath given repentance unto life. And they truly that had been dispersed by the tribulation that was made under Steven, walked throughout unto Phoenice &amp; Cypres &amp; Antioch, speaking the word to none, but to the Jews only. But certain of them were men of Cypres and Cyrene, who when they were entered into Antioch, spake to the Greeks, preaching our Lord JESUS. And the hand of our Lord was with them: and a great number of believers was converted to our Lord. And the report came to the ears of the Church that was at Jerusalem, touching these things: and they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch. Who when he was come, and saw the grace of God, rejoiced: and he exhorted all with purpose of heart to continue in our Lord: because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and faith. And a great multitude was added to our Lord. And he went forth to Tarsus, to seek Saul: whom when he had found, he brought him to Antioch. And they conversed there in the church a whole year: and they taught a great multitude, so that the Disciples were at Antioch first named CHRISTIANS. And in these days there came Prophets from Jerusalem to Antioch, and one of them rising, named Agabus, did by the Spirit signify a great famine that should be in the whole world, which fell under Claudius. And the Disciples according as each man had, purposed every one to send, for to serve the brethren that dwelt in Jewry: which also they did, sending to the ancients by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</div>
