			<div class='roleText'>THE beginning of the Gospel of JESUS CHRIST the Son of God. As it is written in Esay the Prophet: (Behold I send mine Angel before thy face, who shall prepare thy way before thee.) A voice of one crying in the desert. Prepare ye the way of our Lord, make straight his paths. John was in the desert baptizing, and preaching the Baptism of penance unto remission of sins. And there went forth to him all the country of Jewry, and all they of Jerusalem, and were baptized of him in the river of Jordan, confessing their sins. And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a girdle of a skin about his loins: and he did eat locusts and wild honey. And he preached, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>There cometh a stronger than I after me, whose latchet of his shoes I am not worthy stooping down to loose. I have baptized you with water; but he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. And it came to pass, in those days came JESUS from Nazareth of Galilee; and was baptized of John in Jordan. And forthwith coming up out of the water, he saw the Heavens opened, and the Spirit as a dove descending, and remaining on him. And a voice was made from Heaven: Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased. And forthwith the Spirit drove him out into the desert. And he was in the desert forty days, and forty nights: and was tempted of Satan, and he was with beasts, and the Angels ministered to him. And after that John was delivered up, JESUS came into Galilee, preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom of God, and saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>That the time is fulfilled, and the Kingdom of God is at hand: be penitent, and believe the Gospel. And passing by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew his brother, casting nets into the sea (for they were fishers) and JESUS said to them: Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men. And immediately leaving their nets, they followed him. And being gone thence a little further, he saw James of Zebedee, and John his brother, and them repairing their nets in the ship: and forthwith he called them. And leaving their father Zebedee in the ship with his hired men, they followed him. And they enter into Capharnaum, and he forthwith upon the Sabboths going into the Synagogue, taught them. And they were astonished at his doctrine. For he was teaching them as having power, and not as the Scribes. And there was in their Synagogue a man in an unclean Spirit; and he cried out, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What to us and to thee JESUS of Nazareth? art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Saint of God. And JESUS threatened him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hold thy peace, and go out of the man. And the unclean Spirit tearing him, and crying out with a great voice, went out of him. And they marveled all, in so much that they questioned among themselves, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What thing is this? What is this new doctrine? For with power he commandeth the unclean spirits also, and they obey him. And the bruit of him went forth incontinent into all the country of Galilee. And immediately going forth out of the Synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. And Simon's wife's mother lay in a fit of a fever: and forthwith they tell him of her. And coming near he lifted her up taking her by the hand: and incontinent the ague left her, and she ministered unto them. And when it was evening after sun set, they brought to him all that were ill at ease and that had devils. And all the city was gathered together at the door. And he cured many that were vexed with diverse diseases; and he cast out many devils, and he suffered not them to speak that they knew him. And rising very early, and going forth he went into a desert place: and there he prayed. And Simon sought after him, and they that were with him. And when they had found him, they said to him, That all seek for thee. And he saith to them: Let us go into the next towns and cities, that I may preach there also; for to this purpose am I come. And he was preaching in their Synagogues, and in all Galilee, and casting out devils. And a leper cometh to him beseeching him; and kneeling down saith to him: If thou wilt, thou canst make me clean. And JESUS having compassion on him, stretched forth his hand; and touching him, he saith unto him: I will. Be thou made clean. And when he had spoken, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean. And he threatened him, and forthwith cast him forth. And he saith to him: See thou tell nobody, but go, shew thyself to the high Priest, and offer for thy cleansing the things that Moyses commanded, for a testimony to them. But he being gone forth, began to publish, and to blase abroad the word: so that now he could not openly go into the city, but was abroad in desert places, and they came together unto him from all sides.</div>
