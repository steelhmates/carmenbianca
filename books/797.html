			<div class='roleText'>And thou shalt say in that day: I will confess to thee o Lord, because thou wast angry with me: thy fury is turned away, and thou hast comforted me. Behold God is my saviour, I will do confidently, and will not fear: because our Lord is my strength, and my praise, &amp; he is become my salvation. You shall draw waters in joy out of the saviour's fountains. And you shall say in that day: Confess ye to our Lord, and invocate his name: make his inventions known among the peoples: remember that his name is high. Sing ye to our Lord, because he hath done magnifically: shew this forth in all the earth. Rejoice, and praise o habitation of Sion: because great in the midst of thee, is the holy one of Israel.</div>
