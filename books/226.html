			<div class='roleText'>And after a certain time, when the days of wheat harvest were at hand, Samson came, meaning to visit his wife, and he brought her a kid of goats. And when he would enter into her chamber as he was wont, her father prohibited him, saying: I thought that thou hadst hated her, and therefore I delivered her to thy friend: but she hath a sister, which is younger &amp; fairer than she, let this be thy wife in stead of her. To whom Samson answered: From this day there shall be no fault in me against the Philisthiims: for I will do you evils. And he went, and caught three hundred foxes, &amp; he coupled them tail to tail, and tied firebrands in the midst: which kindling with fire, he let them go, that they might run abroad hither and thither. Who immediately went on into the corn of the Philisthiims. Which being set on fire, both the corn now carried together, and that which yet stood in the stalk, was all burnt, in so much that the flame consumed the vineyards also &amp; the olivets. And the Philisthiims said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Samson the son in law of the Thamnatheite: because he took his wife, and gave her to another, he hath wrought these things. And the Philisthiims went up, and burnt both the woman and her father. To whom Samson said: </div>

And he struck them with a great plague, so that astonished they laid the calf of the leg upon the thigh. And going down he dwelt in the cave of the rock Etam. Therefore the Philisthiims going up into the Land of Juda camped in the place, which afterward was called Lechi, that is, the jaw bone, where their army was spread abroad. And they of the tribe of Juda said to them: Why are you come up against us? Who answered: That we may bind Samson, we are come, &amp; may repay him the things that he hath wrought against us. There went down therefore three thousand men of Juda, to the cave of the flint Etam, &amp; said to Samson: knowest not thou that the Philistiims reign over us? Why wouldst thou do this thing? To whom he said. As they did to me so have I done to them. To bind thee, quoth they, we are come, and to deliver thee into the hands of the Philisthiims. To whom Samson: Swear, quoth he, and promised me that you kill me not. They said: </div>

Who when he was come to the place of the Jaw-bone and the Philisthiims shouting were come against him, the Spirit of our Lord fell upon him: and as flax is wont to be consumed at the savour of fire, so the bands wherewith he was bound were dissipated and loosed. And finding a jaw bone, to wit, the jaw bone of an ass, which lay there, catching it he slew therewith a thousand men, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>In the jaw bone of an ass, in the jaw of the colt of the asses have I destroyed them, and have struck a thousand men. And when he had ended these words singing, he threw the jaw bone out of his hand, and called the name of that place Ramathlechi, which is interpreted the lifting up of the jaw-bone. And being very thirsty he cried to our Lord, &amp; said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Thou hast given in the hand of thy servant this very great salvation and victory: and behold I die for thirst, and shall fall into the hands of the uncircumcised. Our Lord therefore opened a great tooth in the jaw of the ass, &amp; there issued out of it waters. Which being drunk, he refreshed his spirit, &amp; received strength again. Therefore the name of that place was called: The fountain of him that invocated from the jawbone, until this present day. And he judged Israel in the days of the Philisthiims twenty years.</div>
