			<div class='roleText'>How beautiful art thou my love, how beautiful art thou! Thine eyes as it were of doves', besides that which lieth hid within. Thy ears as the flocks of goats, which have come up from mount Galaad. Thy teeth as flocks of them that are shorn, which have come up from the lavatory, all with twins, and there is no barren among them. Thy lips as a scarlet lace: and thy speech sweet. As a piece of a pomegranate, so are also thy cheeks, besides that which lieth hid within. Thy neck is as the tower of David, which is built with bulwarks: a thousand targets hang on it, all the armour of the valiants. Thy two breasts as two fawns the twins of a row, which feed among the lilies, till the day aspire, and the shadows decline. I will go to the mount of myrrh, and to the little hill of frankincense. Thou art all fair o my love, and there is not a spot in thee. Come from Libanus my spouse, come from Libanus, come: thou shalt be crowned from the head of Amana, from the top of Sanir &amp; Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountains of leopards. Thou hast wounded my heart, my sister^ spouse, thou hast wounded my heart in one of thine eyes, and in one hair of thy neck. How beautiful are thy breasts my sister^ spouse! Thy breasts are more beautiful than wine, and the odour of thine ointments above all aromatical spices. Thy lips my spouse are as an honey-comb distilling, honey and milk are under thy tongue: and the odour of thy garments as the odour of frankincense. My sister^ spouse is a garden inclosed, a garden inclosed, a fountain sealed up. Thy offsprings a paradise of pomegranates with orchard fruits. Cypress with spikenard, spikenard, and saffron, sweet cane and cinnamon, with all the trees of Libanus, myrrh and aloes with all the chief ointments. The fountain of gardens: the well of living waters, which run with violence from Libanus. Arise Northwind, &amp; come Southwind, blow through my garden, and let the aromatical spices thereof flow.</div>
