And his face did shine as the sun: &amp; his garments became white as snow. And behold there appeared to them Moyses and Elias talking with him. And Peter answering, said to JESUS: Lord, it is good for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles, one for thee, and one for Moyses, and one for Elias. And as he was yet speaking, behold a bright cloud overshadowed them. And lo a voice out of the cloud, saying: </div>

And JESUS came and touched them: and he said to them: Arise, and fear not. And they lifting up their eyes, saw nobody, but only JESUS. And as they descended from the mount, JESUS commanded them, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>what say the Scribes then, that Elias must come first? But he answering, said to them: Elias indeed shall come, and restore all things. And I say to you, that Elias is already come, and they did not know him, but wrought on him whatsoever they would. So also the Son of man shall suffer of them. Then the Disciples understood, that of John the Baptist he had spoken to them. And when he was come unto the multitude, there came to him a man falling down upon his knees before him, saying: </div>

JESUS said to them, because of your incredulity: For, Amen I say to you, if you have faith as a mustard seed, you shall say to this mountain, Remove from thence thither, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible to you. But this kind is not cast out but by prayer and fasting. And when they conversed in Galilee, JESUS said to them: The Son of man is to be betrayed into the hands of men: and they shall kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And they were stroken sad exceedingly. And when they were come to Capharnaum, there came they that received the didrachmes, unto Peter, and said to him: Your master doth he not pay the didrachmes?
