Of these were chosen, and distributed into the ministry of the house of our Lord four and twenty thousand: and of the overseers and judges, six thousand. Moreover four thousand porters: and as many singing to our Lord on instruments, which he had made to sing on.

The sons of Leedan: the Prince Jahiel, and Zethan, and Joel, three. The sons of Semei: Salomith, and Hosiel, and Aram, three: these be the Princes of the families of Leedan. Moreover the sons of Semei: Leheth, and Ziza, and Jaus, and Baria: these be the sons of Semei, four.

The children of Caath: Amram, and Isaar, Hebron, and Oziel, four. The sons of Amram, Aaron, and Moyses. And Aaron was separated to minister in Sancta Sanctorum, he and his sons for ever, and to burn incense to our Lord according to his rite, and to bless his name for ever.

			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord the God of Israel hath given rest to his people, and the habitation of Jerusalem for ever. Neither shall it be the office of the Levites to carry any more the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof to minister. According to the last precepts also of David the number of the children of Levi shall be numbered from twenty years &amp; upward. And they shall be under the hand of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of our Lord, in the entrances, and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in the Sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the temple of our Lord. And the Priests over the loaves of proposition, and for the sacrifice of flour, and for cakes and azymes, and the frying pan and to roast, and over all weight and measure. But the Levites to stand in the morning to confess, and sing to our Lord: and in like manner at evening, as well in the oblation of the holocausts of our Lord, as in the Sabbaths and Calends, and the rest of the solemnities, according to the number, and ceremonies of every thing, continually before our Lord. And let them keep the observations of the tabernacle of covenant, and the rite of the Sanctuary, and the observance of the children of Aaron their brethren, that they minister in the house of our Lord.</div>
