Neither shall it be the office of the Levites to carry any more the tabernacle, and all the vessels thereof to minister. According to the last precepts also of David the number of the children of Levi shall be numbered from twenty years &amp; upward. And they shall be under the hand of the sons of Aaron for the service of the house of our Lord, in the entrances, and in the chambers, and in the place of purification, and in the Sanctuary, and in all the works of the ministry of the temple of our Lord. And the Priests over the loaves of proposition, and for the sacrifice of flour, and for cakes and azymes, and the frying pan and to roast, and over all weight and measure. But the Levites to stand in the morning to confess, and sing to our Lord: and in like manner at evening, as well in the oblation of the holocausts of our Lord, as in the Sabbaths and Calends, and the rest of the solemnities, according to the number, and ceremonies of every thing, continually before our Lord. And let them keep the observations of the tabernacle of covenant, and the rite of the Sanctuary, and the observance of the children of Aaron their brethren, that they minister in the house of our Lord.</div>
