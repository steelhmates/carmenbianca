And I will be to it, saith our Lord, a wall of fire round about: and I will be in glory in the midst thereof. O fly ye out of the land of the North, saith our Lord, because into the four winds of heaven have I dispersed you, saith our Lord. O Sion, fly thou that dwellest with the daughter of Babylon: because thus saith the Lord of hosts: After glory he sent me to the nations, that have spoiled you: for he that shall touch you, toucheth the apple of mine eye: because lo I lift up my hand upon them, and they shall be a prey to those that served them: and you shall know that the Lord of hosts sent me. Praise, and rejoice o daughter of Sion: because lo I come, &amp; will dwell in the midst of thee, saith our Lord. And many nations shall be joined to our Lord in that day, and they shall be my people, and I will dwell in the midst of thee: and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts hath sent me to thee. And our Lord will possess Juda his portion in the sanctified land: and he will yet choose Jerusalem. Let all flesh be silent at the presence of our Lord: because he is risen up out of his holy habitation.</div>
