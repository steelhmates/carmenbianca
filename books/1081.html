			<div class='roleText'>JUDGE not, that you be not judged. For in what judgement you judge, you shall be judged: and in what measure you mete, it shall be measured to you again. And why seest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye: and the beam that is in thine own eye thou seest not? Or how sayest thou to thy brother: Let me cast out the mote of thine eye; and behold a beam is in thine own eye? Hypocrite, cast out first the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see to cast out the mote out of thy brother's eye. Give not that which is holy to dogs: neither cast ye your pearls before swine, lest perhaps they tread them with their feet, &amp; turning, all to tear you. Ask, and it shall be given you: seek, and you shall find, knock, &amp; it shall be opened to you. For every one that asketh, receiveth: and that seeketh, findeth: and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. Or what man is there of you, whom if his child shall ask bread, will he reach him a stone? Or if he shall ask him fish, will he reach him a serpent? If you then being naught, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much more will your Father which is in Heaven, give good things to them that ask him? All things therefore whatsoever you will that men do to you, do you also to them. For this is the Law and the Prophets. Enter ye by the narrow gate: because broad is the gate, and large is the way that leadeth to perdition, and many there be that enter by it. How narrow is the gate, and strait is the way that leadeth to life: &amp; few there are that find it! Take ye great heed of false Prophets, which come to you in the clothing of sheep, but inwardly are ravening wolves. By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles? Even so every good tree yieldeth good fruits, and the evil tree yieldeth evil fruits. A good tree cannot yield evil fruits, neither an evil tree yield good fruits. Every tree that yieldeth not good fruit, shall be cut down, and shall be cast into fire. Therefore by their fruits you shall know them. Not every one that sayeth to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven: but he that doth the will of my Father which is in Heaven, he shall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. Many shall say to me in that day: Lord, Lord, have not we prophesied in thy name, and in thy name cast out devils, and in thy name wrought many miracles? And then I will confess unto them, That I never knew you: depart from me you that work iniquity. Every one therefore that heareth these words, and doeth them, shall be likened to a wise man that built his house upon a rock, and the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon a rock. And every one that heareth these my words, and doeth them not, shall be like a foolish man that built his house upon the sand. and the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and they beat against that house, and it fell, &amp; the fall thereof was great. And it came to pass, when JESUS had fully ended these words, the multitude were in admiration upon his doctrine. For he was teaching them as having power, and not as their Scribes and Pharisees.</div>
