			<div class='roleText'>Cry, cease not, as a trumpet exalt thy voice, and tell my people their wicked doings, and the house of Jacob their sins. For me indeed they seek from day to day, and they will know my ways, as a nation that hath done justice, and hath not forsaken the judgement of their God: they ask of me the judgements of justice: they will approach to God. Why have we fasted, and thou hast not regarded: have we humbled our souls, and thou hast not known? Behold in the day of your fast your own will is found, and you exact of all your debters. Behold you fast to debates and contentions, and strike with the fist impiously. Do not fast as until this day, that your cry may be heard on high. Is this such a fast, as I have chosen: for a man by the day to afflict his soul? Is this it, to wind his head about like a circle, and to spread sack-cloth and ashes? Wilt thou call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord? Is not this rather the fast that I have chosen? Dissolve the bands of impiety, loose the bundles that overload, dismiss them free that are broken, and break in sunder every burden. Break thy bread to the hungry &amp; the needy, &amp; harborless bring in into thy house: when thou shalt see the naked cover him, and despise not thy flesh. Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall sooner arise, &amp; thy justice shall go before thy face, and the glory of our Lord shall embrace thee. Then shalt thou invocate, and our Lord will hear: thou shalt cry, and he will say: Lo here I am. If thou wilt take away the chain out of the midst of thee, &amp; cease to stretch out the finger, &amp; to speak that which profiteth not. When thou shalt pour out thy soul to the hungry, and shalt fill the afflicted soul, thy light shall arise up in darkness, &amp; thy darkness shall be as the noon day. And our Lord will give thee rest always, &amp; will fill thy soul with brightness, and deliver thy bones, and thou shalt be as a watered garden, and as a fountain of waters, whose waters shall not fail. And the deserts of the worlds shall be builded in thee, thou shalt raise up the foundations of generation and generation: and thou shalt be called the builder of the hedges, turning the paths into rest. If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy will in my holy day, and call the Sabbath delicate, and the holy of our Lord glorious, and glorify him, whilst thou doest not thine own ways, &amp; thy will be not found, to speak a word: Then shalt thou be delighted upon the Lord, &amp; I will lift thee up above the heights of the earth, &amp; will feed thee with the inheritance of Jacob thy father. For the mouth of the Lord hath spoken.</div>
