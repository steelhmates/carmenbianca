			<div class='roleText'>A faithful saying. If a man desire a Bishop's office, he desireth a good work. It behoveth therefore a Bishop to be irreprehensible, the husband of one wife, sober, wise, comely, chaste, a man of hospitality, a teacher, not given to wine, no fighter, but modest, no quarreler, not covetous, well ruling his own house, having his children subject with all chastity. But if a man know not to rule his own house, how shall he have care of the Church of God? Not a neophyte: lest puffed into pride, he fall into the judgement of the devil. And he must have also good testimony of them that are without: that he fall not into reproach and the snare of the devil. Deacons in like manner chaste, not double-tongued, not given to much wine, not followers of filthy lucre: having the mystery of faith in a pure conscience. And let these also be proved first: &amp; so let them minister, having no crime. The women in like manner chaste, not detracting, sober, faithful in all things. Let deacons be the husbands of one wife: which rule well their children, and their houses. For they that have ministered well, shall purchase to themselves a good degree, and much confidence in the faith which is in Christ JESUS. These things I write to thee, hoping that I shall come to thee quickly. But if I tarry long, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest to converse in the house of God, which is the CHURCH of the living God, the pillar and ground of truth. And manifestly it is a great sacrament of piety, which was manifested in flesh, was justified in spirit, appeared to Angels, hath been preached to Gentiles, is believed in the world, is assumpted in glory.</div>
