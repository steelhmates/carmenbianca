			<div class='roleText'>Eight years old was Josias when he began to reign and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And he did that which was right in the sight of our Lord, and walked in the ways of David his father: he declined not neither to the right hand, nor to the left. And in the eighth year of his reign, when he was yet a child, he began to seek the God of his father David: &amp; the twelfth year after he began to reign, he cleansed Juda and Jerusalem from excelses, and groves, and idols, and sculptiles. And they destroyed before him the altars of Baalim, &amp; the idols that had been set upon them, they destroyed: the groves also and sculptiles he cut down and brake in pieces: and over their tombs, that were accustomed to immolate unto them, he strawed the fragments. Moreover the bones of the Priests he burnt on the altars of the idols, and he cleansed Juda and Jerusalem. Yea and in the cities of Manasses, and of Ephraim, and of Simeon, unto Nephthali he overthrew all. And when he had destroyed the altars, and the groves, and had broken the idols into pieces, and had overthrown all profane temples out of all the land of Israel, he returned into Jerusalem. Therefore in the eighteenth year of his reign, the land now cleansed, and the temple of our Lord, he sent Saphan the son of Eselias, and Maasias the governor of the city, and Joha the son of Joachaz Commenter, that they should repair the house of our Lord his God. Who came to Helcias the high Priest: and taking of him the money, which had been brought into the house of our Lord, and which the Levites and porters had gathered together of Manasses, and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, of all Juda also, and Benjamin, and the inhabiters of Jerusalem, they delivered in their hands, that oversaw the workmen in the house of our Lord, that they should repair the temple, and mend all weak parts. But they gave it to the artificers, and to the masons, that they should buy stones out of the quarries, and timber for the jointures of the building, and for making the roof of the houses, which the kings of Juda had destroyed. Who did all things faithfully. And the overseers of the workmen were Jahath and Abdias of the children of Merari, Zacharias and Mosollam of the children of Caath, which urged the work: all Levites skillful to sing on instruments. But over them, that carried burdens to diverse uses, were scribes, &amp; masters of the Levites, &amp; porters. And when they carried forth the money, that had been brought into the temple of our Lord, Helcias the Priest found the Book of the law of our Lord by the hand of Moyses. And he said to Saphan the Scribe: I have found the Book of the law in the house of our Lord: and delivered it to him. But he brought in the volume to the king, and told him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>All things, which thou gavest into the hand of thy servants, lo are accomplished. The silver that was found in the house of our Lord they have gathered into a mass: and it was given to the overseers of the artificers, and of them that make diverse works. Moreover Helcias the priest delivered me this Book. Which when he had read in the king's presence, and he had heard the words of the law, he rent his garments: and he commanded Helcias, and Ahicam the son of Saphan, and Abdon the son of Micha, Saphan also the scribe, and Asaa the king's servant, saying: Go, and pray our Lord for me, and for the remnant of Israel, and Juda, concerning all the words of this Book, which is found: for the great fury of our Lord hath distilled upon us, for that our fathers have not kept the words of our Lord, to do all things that are written in this volume. Helcias therefore went, and they that were sent together by the king, to Olda a Prophetess, the wife of Sellum the son of Thecuath, the son of Hasra keeper of the garments: who dwelt in Jerusalem in the second part: and they spake to her the words, which we have above mentioned. But she answered them: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: Tell the man, that sent you to me: Thus saith our Lord: Behold I will bring evils upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, and all the curses, that are written in this Book, which they read before the king of Juda. Because they have forsaken me, and have sacrificed to strange gods, that they might provoke me to wrath in all the works of their hands, therefore shall my fury drop upon this place, and shall not be extinguished. But to the king of Juda that sent you to beseech our Lord, thus speak ye: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: Because thou hast heard the words of this volume, and thy heart is mollified, &amp; thou art humbled in the sight of our Lord for these things, which are spoken against this place, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and reverencing my face hast rent thy garments, and wept before me: I also have heard thee, saith our Lord. For now will I gather thee to thy fathers, &amp; thou shalt be brought into thy grave in peace: neither shall thine eyes see all the evil that I will bring in upon this place, and upon the inhabitants thereof. They therefore reported to the king all things that she had said. But he calling together all the ancients of Juda and Jerusalem, went up into the house of our Lord, and all the men of Juda, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Priests and Levites, and all the people from the least to the greatest. In whose hearing in the house of our Lord, the king read all the words of the volume. And standing on his tribunal seat, he made a covenant before our Lord, that he would walk after him, and keep his precepts, and testimonies, and justifications in all his heart, and in all his soul, and would do the things that were written in that volume, which he had read. He adjured also upon this^ all that were found in Jerusalem, and Benjamin: and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of our Lord the God of their fathers. Josias therefore took away all abominations of all the countries of the children of Israel: and made all, that were left in Israel, to serve our Lord their God. All his days they revolted not from our Lord the God of their fathers.</div>
