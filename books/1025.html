			<div class='roleText'>In the four and twentieth day of the month, in the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king. In the seventh month, the one &amp; twentieth of the month, the word of our Lord was made in the hand of Aggeus the Prophet, saying: Speak to Zorobabel the son of Salathiel the Duke of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec the grand Priest, and to the rest of the people, saying: Who among you is left, that saw this house in the first glory thereof? And what do you see this same now? Why, is it not so, as if it were not in your eyes? And now take courage Zorobabel, saith our Lord, and take courage Jesus the son of Josedec grand Priest, and take courage all ye people of the land, saith the Lord of hosts: &amp; do (because I am with you, saith the Lord of hosts) the word that I did covenant with you when you came out of the Land of Aegypt: &amp; my spirit shall be in the midst of you: fear not. Because thus saith the Lord of hosts: As yet there is one little while, and I will move the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land. And I will move all nations: AND THE DESIRED OF ALL NATIONS SHALL COME: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the Lord of hosts. Mine is the silver, &amp; mine is the gold, saith the Lord of hosts. Great shall be the glory of this last house, more than of the first, saith the Lord of hosts: and in this place will I give peace, saith the Lord of hosts. In the four and twentieth of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius the king, the word of our Lord was made to Aggeus the Prophet, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Ask the Priests the law, saying: If a man take sanctified flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touch with the skirt thereof bread, or broth, or wine, or oil, or any meat: shall it be sanctified? And the Priests answering, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>So this people, and so this nation before my face, saith our Lord, and so all the work of their hands: &amp; all that they have offered there, shall be contaminated. And now set your hearts, from this day &amp; upward, before there was stone laid upon stone in the temple of our Lord. When you went to an heap of twenty bushels, and they became ten: and entered into the press, to press out fifty flagons, &amp; they became twenty. I struck you with the burning wind, and with the blast, and with hail, all the works of your hands: and there was none among you, that returned to me, saith our Lord. Set your hearts from this day, &amp; henceforward, from the four &amp; twentieth day of the ninth month: from the day that the foundations of the temple of our Lord were laid, lay it upon your hearts. Is there the seed now abreward? And as yet the wine, and the fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-tree hath not flourished? From this day I will bless. And the word of our Lord was made the second time to Aggeus in the four and twentieth of the month, saying: Speak to Zorobabel the Duke of Juda, saying: </div>

In that day, saith the Lord of hosts, I will take thee o Zorobabel son of Salathiel my servant, saith our Lord, and will put thee as a signet, because thee have I chosen, saith the Lord of hosts.</div>
