			<div class='roleText'>AND we helping do exhort, that you receive not the grace of God in vain. (For he saith: In time accepted have I heard thee; and in the day of salvation have I holpen thee. Behold, now is the time acceptable: behold now the day of salvation.) to no man giving any offence, that our ministry be not blamed: but in all things let us exhibit ourselves as the ministers of God, in much patience, in tribulations, in necessities, in distresses, in stripes, in prisons, in seditions, in labours, in watchings, in fastings, in chastity, in knowledge, in longanimity, in sweetness, in the Holy Ghost, in charity not feigned, in the word of truth, in the virtue of God; by the armour of justice on the right hand, and on the left, by honour and dishonour, by infamy and good fame: as seducers, and true: as they that are unknown, and known: as dying, and behold we live: as chastened, &amp; not killed: as sorrowful, but always rejoicing: as needy, but enriching many: as having nothing, and possessing all things. Our mouth is open to you, o Corinthians, our heart is dilated. You are not straitened in us: but in your own bowels you are straitened. But having the same reward (I speak as to my children) be you also dilated. Bear not the yoke with infidels. For what participation hath justice with iniquity? or what society is there between light and darkness? And what agreement with Christ and Belial? or what part hath the faithful with the infidel? And what agreement hath the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God: as God saith, That I will dwell, and walk in them, and will be their God; and they shall be my people. For the which cause, Go out of the midst of them, and separate yourselves, saith our Lord, and touch not the unclean: and I will receive you. and I will be a father to you: and you shall be my sons &amp; daughters, saith our Lord omnipotent.</div>
