			<div class='roleText'>For behold the day shall come kindled as a furnace: and all the proud, and all that do impiety shall be stubble: &amp; the day coming shall inflame them, saith the Lord of hosts, which shall not leave them root, and spring. And there shall rise to you that fear my name the Sun of justice, and health in his wings: and you shall go forth, and shall leap as calves of the herd. And you shall tread the impious, when they shall be ashes under the sole of your feet in the day, that I do, saith the Lord of hosts. Remember ye the law of Moyses my servant, which I commanded him in Horeb to all Israel precepts, and judgements. Behold I will send you Elias the Prophet, before the day of our Lord come great and dreadful. And he shall convert the heart of the fathers to the children, &amp; the heart of the children to their fathers: lest perhaps I come, and strike the earth with anathema.</div>
