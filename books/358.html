			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass after the compass of a year, at such time when kings are wont to go forth to battle, Joab gathered together the army and force of war, and spoiled the land of the children of Ammon: and went on and besieged Rabba. Moreover David tarried in Jerusalem, when Joab struck Rabba, and destroyed it. And David took the crown of Melchom from his head, and found in it a talent weight of gold, and most precious pearls, and he made himself thereof a diadem: he took also the spoils of the city very much. And the people that was therein, he brought forth: and he made harrows, and sleds, and chariots shod with Iron to pass over them, so that they were cut asunder, and broken in pieces: so did David to all the cities of the children of Ammon: and he returned with all his people into Jerusalem. After these things there was war begun in Gazer against the Philisthians: in which Sobochai the Husathite struck Saphai of the kindred of Raphaim, and humbled them. Another battle also was fought against the Philisthians, wherein Adeodatus the son of Saltus a Bethlehemite struck the brother of Goliath the Getheite, the staff of whose spear was as it were a weaver's beam. But another battle also happened in Geth, wherein there was a very long man, having fingers and toes by six &amp; six, that is, together four &amp; twenty: who also was born of the stock of Rapha. This man blasphemed Israel: and Jonathan the son of Samaa the brother of David struck him. These be the children of Rapha in Geth, which fell by the hand of David and of his servants.</div>
