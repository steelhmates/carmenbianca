			<div class='roleText'>And there was a man of Benjamin named Cis, the son of Abiel, the son of Seor, the son of Bechorath, the son of Aphia, the son of a man of Jemini, valiant in strength. And he had a son called Saul, chosen and good: and there was not a man of the children of Israel better than he: from the shoulder and upward he appeared above all the people. And the asses of Cis the father of Saul were lost: and Cis said to Saul his son: Take one of the servants with thee, and rising go, &amp; seek the asses. Who when they had passed by mount Ephraim, &amp; by the land of Salisa, &amp; had not found, they passed also through the land of Salim, and they were not: yea and by the Land of Jemini, and found them not. And when they were come into the Land of Suph, Saul said to the servant that was with him: Come let us return, lest perhaps my father hath let alone the asses, and be careful for us. Who said to him: Behold a man of God is in this city, a famous man: all that he speaketh, cometh to pass without doubt, now therefore let us go thither, if perhaps he may tell us of our way, for which we are come. And Saul said to his servant: Lo we will go: what shall we carry to the man of God? The bread is spent in our males: and present we have none to give unto the man of God, nor any thing else. Again the servant answered Saul and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Behold there is found in my hand the fourth part of a sicle of silver, let us give it to the man of God, that he may tell us our way. (For in time past in Israel so every man spake, going to consult God, Come, and let us go to the seer. For he that at this day is called a Prophet, in time past was called a seer.) And Saul said to his servant: Thy word is very good, come let us go. And they went into the city, wherein the man of God was. And when they went up the ascent of the city, they found maids coming forth to draw water, and said to them: Is the seer here? Who answering said to them: Here he is. Lo before thee, make haste now, for this day he came into the city, because this day there is a sacrifice of the people in the excelse. Entering into the city immediately you shall find him, before he go up into the excelse to eat, for the people will not eat till he come: because he will bless the Host, and afterward they shall eat that are invited. Now therefore go up, because this day you shall find him. And they went up into the city. And when they walked in the midst of the city, Samuel appeared coming forth against them, to go up into the excelse. And our Lord had revealed the ear of Samuel one day before Saul came, saying: This very hour, that now is, tomorrow will I send to thee a man of the Land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him ruler over my people of Israel: &amp; he shall save my people from the hand of the Philistiims: because I have respected my people, for their cry is come to me. And when Samuel had beheld Saul, our Lord said to him: behold the man, of whom I told thee, this man shall rule over my people. And Saul came to Samuel in the midst of the gate, &amp; said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I am the seer, go up before me into the excelse, that you may eat with me today, &amp; I will dismiss thee in the morning: and all things that are in thy heart, will I tell thee. And concerning the asses, which thou didst lose three days agone, be not careful, because they are found. And whose shall be all the best things of Israel? Not to thee and to all thy father's house? And Saul answering, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Am not I the son of Jemini of the least tribe of Israel, and my kindred the last among all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why therefore hast thou spoken this word to me? Samuel therefore taking Saul &amp; his servant, brought them into the parlour, &amp; gave them a place in the chief room of them that were invited. For there were about thirty men. And Samuel said to the cook: Give the portion, which I gave thee, and commanded that thou shouldst lay it up apart with thee. And the cook lifted up a shoulder, &amp; set it before Saul. And Samuel said: </div>

And they descended from the excelse into the town, &amp; he spake with Saul in the top of the house: &amp; he prepared a bed for Saul in the highest room, &amp; he slept. And when they were risen in the morning, and it began now to be light, Samuel called Saul in the high chamber, saying: </div>

And when they came down in the uttermost part of the city, Samuel said to Saul: Speak to the servant that he go before us, and pass: but stay thou a little while, that I may tell thee the word of our Lord.</div>
