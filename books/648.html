			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Praise ye the name of our Lord, ye servants praise our Lord. Ye that stand in the house of our Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Praise ye our Lord, because our Lord is good: sing ye to his name, because it is sweet. Because our Lord hath chosen Jacob to himself, Israel for his own possession. Because I have known that our Lord is great, and our God above all gods. All things whatsoever our Lord would he hath done, in heaven, in earth, in the sea, and in all the depths. Bring forth clouds from the uttermost of the earth: lightnings he hath turned into rain. Who bringeth forth the winds out of his treasures: who struck the first begotten of Aegypt from man even to beast. He sent forth signs and wonders in the midst of thee, o Aegypt: upon Pharao, and upon all his servants. Who struck many nations: and slew strong kings: Sehon the king of the Amorrheites, &amp; Og the king of Basan, and all the Kingdoms of Chanaan. And he gave their land for inheritance, for an inheritance to Israel his people. Lord thy name is for ever: Lord thy memorial is unto generation and generation. Because our Lord shall judge his people: and will be entreated toward his servants. The idols of the Gentiles are silver, and gold, the works of men's hands. They have mouth, &amp; shall not speak: they have eyes, and shall not see. They have ears, and shall not hear: for neither is there breath in their mouth. Let them that make them become like to them: and all that have confidence in them. Ye house of Israel bless our Lord: ye house of Aaron bless our Lord. Ye house of Levi bless our Lord: you that fear our Lord, bless ye our Lord. Blessed be our Lord out of Sion, who dwelleth in Jerusalem.</div>
