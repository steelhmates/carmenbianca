			<div class='roleText'>How came this fellow by all these things? &amp; what wisdom is this that is given to him, and such virtues as are wrought by his hands? Is not this the Carpenter, the son of MARY, the brother of James, and Joseph, and Jude, and Simon? Why, are not also his sisters here with us? And they were scandalized in him. And JESUS said to them: That there is not a Prophet without honour, but in his own country, and in his own house, and in his own kindred. And he could not do any miracle there, but only cured a few that were sick, imposing his hands. And he marveled because of their incredulity, and he went about the towns in circuit teaching. And he called the Twelve; and began to send them two and two, and gave them power over unclean spirits. And he commanded them that they should take nothing for the way, but a rod only: not scrip, not bread, nor money in their purse, but shod with sandals, and that they should not put on two coats. And he said to them: Withersoever you shall enter into an house, there tarry till you depart thence. And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear you; going forth from thence shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony to them. And going forth they preached that they should do penance: And they cast out many devils, and anointed with oil many sick, and healed them. And king Herod heard (for his name was made manifest) and he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>John whom I beheaded, he is risen again from the dead. For the said Herod sent and apprehended John, and bound him in prison for Herodias the wife of Philippe his brother, because he had married her. For John said to Herod: It is not lawful for thee to have thy brother's wife, And Herodias lay in wait for him: and was desirous to kill him, and could not. For Herod feared John, knowing him to be a just and holy man: and he kept him, and by hearing him did many things: and he heard him gladly. And when a convenient day was fallen, Herod made the supper of his birth-day to the Princes, and the Tribunes, and the chief of Galilee. And when the daughter of the same Herodias came in, and had danced, and pleased Herod, and them that sat with him at the table, the king said to the damsel: Ask of me what thou wilt, and I will give it thee. And he sware to her: That whatsoever thou shalt ask I will give thee, though the half of my kingdom. Who when she was gone forth, said to her mother, what shall I ask? But she said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will that forthwith thou give me in a platter the head of John the Baptist. And the king was stroken sad. Because of his oath and for them that sat together at table he would not displease her: but sending the hangman, commanded that his head should be brought in a platter. And he beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head in a platter: and gave it to the damsel, and the damsel gave it to her mother. Which his Disciples hearing^ came, and took his body; and they put it in a monument. And the Apostles gathering together unto JESUS, made relation to him of all things that they had done and taught. And he said to them: Come apart into the desert place, and rest a little. For there were that came and went, many: and they had not so much as space to eat. And going up into the boat, they went into a desert place apart. And they saw them going away, and many knew: and they ran flocking thither on foot from all cities, and prevented them. And going forth, JESUS saw a great multitude; and he had compassion on them, because they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. And when the day was now far spent, his Disciples came to him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Give ye them to eat. And they said to him: Let us go and buy bread for two hundred pence, and we will give them to eat. And he saith to them: How many loaves have you? Go and see. And when they knew, they say: Five, and two fishes. And he commanded them that they should make all sit down, by companies upon the green grass. And they sat down in ranks by hundreds and fifties. And when he had taken the five loaves, and the two fishes: looking up unto Heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves, and gave to his Disciples to set before them: and the two fishes he divided to all. And all did eat, and had their fill. And they took up the leavings, twelve full baskets of fragments, and of the fishes. And they that did eat, were five thousand men. And immediately he compelled his Disciples to go up into the boat, that they might go before him beyond the strait to Bethsaida: whiles himself did dismiss the people. And when he had dismissed them, he went into the mountain to pray. And when it was late, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone on the land. And seeing them labouring in rowing (for the wind was against them) and about the fourth watch of the night he cometh to them walking upon the sea, and he would have passed by them. But they seeing him walking upon the sea, thought it was a ghost, and cried out. For all saw him, and were troubled. And immediately he talked with them, and said to them: Have confidence, it is I, fear ye not. And he went up to them into the ship, and the wind ceased: and they were far more astonished within themselves: for they understood not concerning the loaves; for their heart was blinded. And when they had passed over, they came into the land of Genesareth, and set to the shore. And when they were gone out of the boat, incontinent they knew him: and running through that whole country they began to carry about in couches those that were ill at ease, where they heard he was. And whithersoever he entered into towns or into villages or cities, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought him that they might touch but the hem of his garment: and as many as touched him, were made whole.</div>
