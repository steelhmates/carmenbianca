			<div class='roleText'>Take courage ye children of Benjamin in the midst of Jerusalem, and in Thecua sound with the trumpet, and over Bethacarem lift up the standard: because there is evil seen from the North, and great destruction. I have resembled the daughter of Sion to a beautiful and delicate woman. To her shall Pastors come, and their flocks: they have pitcht tents in her round about: every one shall feed them that are under his hand. Sanctify ye battle upon her: arise, and let us go up in the midday: woe unto us, because the day is declined, because the shadows of the evening are waxen longer. Arise, and let us go up in the night, and destroy her houses. Because thus saith the Lord of hosts: Hew down her wood, cast a trench about Jerusalem: this is the city of visitation, all oppression is in the midst thereof. As a cistern maketh cold the water thereof, so hath she made cold her malice: iniquity and spoil shall be heard in her, infirmity and plague always before me. Be thou taught Jerusalem, lest perhaps my soul depart from thee, lest perhaps I make thee a desert land not habitable. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Even to one cluster shall they gather as in a vineyard the remains of Israel, turn back thy hand, as the grape gatherer to the basket. To whom shall I speak? And whom shall I contest, that he may hear? Behold, their ears are uncircumcised, and they cannot hear: behold the word of our Lord is become unto them as a reproach: and they will not receive it. Therefore am I full of the fury of our Lord, I have laboured sustaining: pour out upon the little one without, and upon the counsel of the young men together: for man with woman shall be taken, the ancient with him that is full of days. And their houses shall pass to others, their lands and wives together: because I will extend my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith our Lord. For from the lesser even to the greater, all study avarice: and from the Prophets even to the Priest, all commit guile. And they cured the destruction of the daughter of my people with ignominy, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Peace, peace: and there was not peace. They were confounded, because they did abomination: yea rather they were not confounded with confusion, and they knew not how to blush, for the which thing, they shall fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation, they shall fall down, saith our Lord. Thus saith our Lord: Stand ye upon the ways, and see, and ask of the old paths, which is the good way, and walk ye in it: and you shall find refreshing for your souls. And they said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>We will not hear. Therefore hear ye, o Gentiles, and thou congregation know, what great things I will do to them. Hear o earth: Behold I will bring evils upon this people, the fruits of their cogitations: because they have not heard my words, and they have cast off my law. To what purpose bring you me frankincense from Saba, and the sweet smelling cane from a far country? Your holocausts are not acceptable, and your victims have not pleased me. Therefore thus saith our Lord: Behold I will bring ruin upon this people, and the fathers with the children shall fall in them together, neighbour and neighbour, and they shall perish. Thus saith our Lord: Behold there cometh a people from the land of the North, and a great nation shall arise up from the ends of the earth. It shall take arrow and shield: it is cruel, and will have no mercy. The voice thereof shall sound as the sea: and they shall mount upon horses, prepared as a man to battle, against thee, o daughter of Sion. We have heard the fame thereof, our hands are dissolved: tribulation hath caught us, sorrows as a woman in travail. Go not out of the fields, and walk not in the way: because the sword of the enemy is fear round about. Be girded with sackcloth, o daughter of my people, and be sprinkled with ashes: make thee a bitter lamentation as the mourning of the only-begotten, because the destroyer shall suddenly come upon us. I have set thee a strong prover in my people: and thou shalt know, and prove their way. All these Princes are declining, walking deceitfully, brass and iron: they are all corrupted. The bellows have failed, the lead is consumed in the fire, the founder hath melted in vain: for their malices are not consumed. Call ye them reprobate silver, because our Lord hath rejected them.</div>
