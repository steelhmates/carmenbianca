			<div class='roleText'>And God blessed Noe and his sons, And he said to them: Increase &amp; multiply, and replenish the earth. And your terror and dread be it upon all the beasts of the earth, and upon all the fowls of the air, with all that move upon the earth: all the fishes of the sea are delivered to your hand. And all that moveth and liveth shall be yours for meat: even as the green herbs have I delivered all to you. Saving that flesh with blood you shall not eat. For I will require the blood of your souls at the hands of all beasts: and at the hand of man, at the hand of each man, and of his brother, will I require the soul of man. Whosoever shall shed man's blood, his blood shall be shed: for to the image of God man was made. But increase you and multiply, and go upon the earth, and fill it. Thus also said God to Noe, and his sons with him: Behold I will establish my covenant with you, and with your seed after you: and with every living soul that is with you, as well in all fowls as in cattle &amp; beasts of the earth that are come forth out of the ark, and in all beasts of the earth. I will establish my covenant with you, and all flesh shall be no more destroyed with the waters of a flood, neither shall there be from hence-forth a flood to waste the earth. And God said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This is the sign of the covenant which I give between me and you, and between every living soul, that is with you, for perpetual generations: my bow will I set in the clouds, and it shall be the sign of a covenant between me and between the earth. And when I shall cover the element with clouds, my bow shall appear in the clouds: and I shall remember my covenant with you, and with every living soul that beareth flesh: and there shall no more be waters of a flood, to destroy all flesh. And my bow shall be in the clouds, and I shall see it, and I shall remember the everlasting covenant, that was made between God and every living soul of all flesh which is upon the earth. And God said to Noe: This shall be the sign of the covenant, which I established between me &amp; all flesh of the earth. The sons therefore of Noe, that came out of the ark, were Sem, Cham, and Japheth: and Cham he is the father of Chanaan. These three are the sons of Noe: and of these was all mankind spread over the whole earth. And Noe a husbandman began to till the ground, and planted a vineyard. And drinking of the wine was made drunk, and naked in his tabernacle. Which when Cham the father of Chanaan had seen, to wit that his father's privities were bare, he told it to his two brethren abroad. But indeed Sem and Japhet put a cloak upon their shoulders, and going backward, covered the privities of their father: and their faces were turned away, and they saw not their father's privities. And Noe awaking from the wine, when he had learned what his younger son had done to him, he said: </div>

God enlarge Japheth, and dwell he in the tabernacles of Sem, and Chanaan be his servant. And Noe lived after the flood three hundred fifty years. And all his days were in the whole nine hundred fifty years: and he died.</div>
