			<div class='roleText'>WHEN JESUS therefore understood that the Pharisees heard that JESUS maketh more Disciples, and baptizeth, than John, (howbeit JESUS did not baptize, but his Disciples) he left Jewry, and went again into Galilee. And he had of necessity to pass through Samaria. He cometh therefore into a city of Samaria which is called Sichar; beside the manor that Jacob gave to Joseph his son. And there was there the fountain of Jacob. JESUS therefore wearied of his journey, sat so upon the fountain. It was about the sixth hour. There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. JESUS said to her: Give me to drink. For his Disciples were gone into the city, to buy meats. Therefore that Samaritane woman saith to him: How doest thou being a Jew, ask of me to drink, which am a Samaritane woman? For the Jews do not communicate with the Samaritans. JESUS answered, and said to her: If thou didst know the gift of God, and who he is that saith unto thee, Give me to drink; thou perhaps wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water. The woman saith to him: Sir, neither hast thou wherein to draw, and the well is deep; whence hast thou the living water? art thou greater than our Father Jacob, who gave us the well, &amp; himself drank of it, and his children, and his cattle? JESUS answered, and said to her: Every one that drinketh of this water, shall thirst again; but he that shall drink of the water that I will give him, shall not thirst for ever, but the water that I will give him, shall become in him a fountain of water springing up unto life everlasting. The woman saith to him: Lord give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come hither to draw. JESUS saith to her: Go, call thy husband, and come hither. The woman answered and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I have no husband. JESUS said to her: Thou hast said well, that I have no husband. For thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast, is not thy husband. This thou hast said truly. The woman saith to him: Lord, I perceive that thou art a Prophet. Our Fathers adored in this mountain, and you say, that at Jerusalem is the place where men must adore. JESUS saith to her: Woman believe me, that the hour shall come, when you shall neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem adore the Father. You adore that you know not: we adore that we know; for salvation is of the Jews. But the hour cometh, and now it is, when the true adorers shall adore the Father in spirit and verity. For the Father also seeketh such to adore him. God is a Spirit, and they that adore him, must adore in spirit and verity. The woman saith to him: I know that MESSIAS cometh, (which is called CHRIST) therefore when he cometh, he will shew us all things. JESUS saith to her: I am he, that speak with thee. And incontinent his Disciples came: and they marveled that he talked with a woman. No man for all that said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What seekest thou, or why talkest thou with her? The woman therefore left her water-pot: and she went into the city, and saith to those men: Come, and see a man that hath told me all things whatsoever I have done. Is not he CHRIST? They went forth therefore out of the city, and came to him. In the mean time the Disciples desired him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Rabbi eat. But he said to them: I have meat to eat which you know not. The Disciples therefore said one to another: Hath any man brought him for to eat? JESUS saith to them: My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, to perfit his work. Do not you say that yet there are four months, and harvest cometh? Behold I say to you, lift up your eyes, and see the Countries, that they are white already to harvest. And he that reapeth, receiveth hire, and gathereth fruit unto life everlasting: that both he that soweth, and he that reapeth, may rejoice together. For in this is the saying true: that it is one man that soweth, and it is another that reapeth. I have sent you to reap that which you laboured not: others have laboured, &amp; you have entered into their labours. And of that city many believed in him of the Samaritans, for the word of the woman giving testimony, that he told me all things whatsoever I have done. Therefore when the Samaritans were come to him, they desired him that he would tarry there. And he tarried there two days. And many more believed for his own word. And they said to the woman, That now not for thy saying do we believe; for ourselves have heard, and do know that this is the Saviour of the world indeed. And after two days he departed thence; and went into Galilee. For JESUS himself gave testimony that a Prophet hath not honour in his own country: Therefore when he was come into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, whereas they had seen all things that he had done at Jerusalem in the festival day: for themselves also came to the festival day. He came again therefore into Cana of Galilee, where he made water wine. And there was a certain lord whose son was sick at Capharnaum. He having heard that JESUS came from Jewry into Galilee, went to him, and desired him that he would come down and heal his son, For he began to die. JESUS therefore said to him: Unless you see signs and wonders, you believe not. The lord saith to him: Lord, come down before that my son die. JESUS saith to him: Go, thy son liveth. The man believed the word that JESUS said to him, and went. And as he was now going down, his servants met him: and they brought word, saying, That his son lived. He asked therefore of them the hour, wherein he was amended. And they said to him, That yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. The father therefore knew that it was in the same hour wherein JESUS said to him: Thy son liveth, and himself believed and his whole house. This again the second sign did JESUS, when he was come from Jewry into Galilee.</div>
