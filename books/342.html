And he that made the Sun to stand, and the men of Lying, and Secure, and Burning, which were Princes in Moab, &amp; which returned into Lahem. And these are old words. These are potters, dwelling in Plantings, and in Hedges, with the king in his works, and they abode there. The sons of Simeon: Namuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zara, Saul: Sellum his son, Mapsam his son, Masma his son. The sons of Masma: Hamuel his son, Zachur his son, Semei his son. The sons of Semei sixteen, and six daughters: but his brethren had not many sons, and the whole kindred could not reach to the sum of the children of Juda. And they dwelt in Bersabee, and Molada, and Hasarsuhal, and in Bala, and in Asom, and in Tholad, and in Bathuel, and in Hormi, and in Siceleg, and in Bethmarcaboth, and in Hasarsusim, and in Bethberai, and in Saarim.

These renowned Princes in their kindreds, and in the house of their affinities they were multiplied exceedingly. And they went forth to enter into Gador as far as the East side of the valley, and to seek pastures for their flocks. And they found fat pastures, and very good, and a country very large and quiet and fruitful, in the which before had dwelt the stock of Cham. These therefore, whom before we described by name, came in the days of Ezechias the king of Juda: and they struck their tabernacles, and the inhabitants that were found there, &amp; clean destroyed them until this present day: and they dwelt for them, because they found there most fat pastures. Also of the children of Simeon there went into mount Seir five hundred men, having their Princes Phaltias and Naaria and Raphaia and Oziel the sons of Jesi: and they struck the remnant of the Amalecites, which were able to escape, and they dwelt there for them until this day.</div>
