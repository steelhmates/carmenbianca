			<div class='roleText'>And now to you this commandment o ye priests. If you will not hear, and if you will not set it upon the heart, to give glory to my name, saith the Lord of hosts: I will send upon you poverty, and will curse your blessings, and I will curse them: because you have not set it upon the heart. Behold I will cast forth to you the arm, and will sprinkle upon your face the dung of your solemnities, and it shall take you with it. And you shall know that I sent you this commandment, that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. My covenant was with him of life and peace: &amp; I gave him fear: and he feared me, and at the face of my name he was afraid. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips: in peace, and in equity he walked with me, and turned away many from iniquity. For the lips of the Priest shall keep knowledge, and the law they shall require of his mouth: because he is the angel of the Lord of hosts. But you have departed out of the way, and have scandalized many in the law: you have made void the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hosts. For which cause I also have made you contemptible and base to all peoples, as you have not kept my ways, and have accepted face in the law. Why, is there not one father to us all?

Our Lord will destroy the man, that hath done this, the master, and the scholar out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that offereth gift to the Lord of hosts. And this again have you done, you covered the altar of the Lord with tears, with weeping, and howling, so that I have respect no more to sacrifice, neither do I accept any placable thing at your hand. And you have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>For what cause? Because the Lord hath testified between thee, and the wife of thy youth, whom thou hast despised: and she thy partaker, and the wife of thy covenant. Did not one make, and the residue of the spirit is his? And what doth one seek, but the seed of God? Keep ye then your spirit, and the wife of thy youth despise thou not. When thou shalt hate, dismiss, saith our Lord the God of Israel: but iniquity shall cover his garment, saith the Lord of hosts, keep ye your spirit, and do not despise. You have in your words made our Lord to labour: and you said: </div>
