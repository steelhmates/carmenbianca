			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end the Psalm of David. Judge me, o Lord, because I have walked in my innocency: and hoping in our Lord I shall not be weakened. Prove me Lord, and tempt me: burn my reins and my heart. Because thy mercy is before mine eyes: and I am well pleased in thy truth. I have not sitten with the Council of vanity: and with them that do unjust things I will not enter in. I have hated the Church of the malignant: and with the impious I will not sit. I will wash my hands among innocents: and will compass thy altar, o Lord: That I may hear the voice of praise, and shew forth all thy marvelous works. Lord I have loved the beauty of thy house, and the place of the habitation of thy glory. Destroy not, o God, my soul with the impious, and my life with bloody men. In whose hands are iniquities: their right hand is replenished with gifts. But I have walked in mine innocency: redeem me, and have mercy on me. My foot hath stood in the direct way: in the Churches I will bless thee o Lord.</div>
