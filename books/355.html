			<div class='roleText'>And when David dwelt in his house, he said to Nathan the Prophet: Behold I dwell in a house of cedar: and the Ark of the covenant of our Lord is under skins. And Nathan said to David: All things, that are in thy heart do: for God is with thee. Therefore that night the word of God came to Nathan, saying: Go, and speak to David my servant: Thus saith our Lord: Thou shalt not build me a house to dwell in. For neither have I remained in house from the time, that I brought out Israel, until this day: but I have been always changing places of tabernacle, &amp; in tent, abiding with all Israel. Did I speak to one, at the least, of all the judges of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people, and did I say: Why have you not built me a house of cedar? Now therefore so shalt thou speak to my servant David: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I took thee, when in the pastures thou didest follow the flock, that thou shouldest be Prince of my people Israel. And I have been with thee whither soever thou wentest: and I have slain all thine enemies before thee, and have made thee a name as of one of the great ones, that are renowned in the earth. And I have given a place to my people Israel: it shall be planted, and shall dwell therein, and shall be moved no more, neither shall the children of iniquity consume them, as from the beginning, since the days that I gave judges to my people Israel, &amp; humbled all thine enemies. I therefore tell thee, that our Lord will build thee a house. And when thou shalt have accomplished thy days to go to thy fathers, I will raise up thy seed after thee, which shall be of thy children: and I will establish his Kingdom. He shall build me a house, and I will confirm his throne for ever. I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to me for a son: and my mercy I will not take from him, as I took from him, that was before thee. And I will establish him in my house, and in my Kingdom for ever: and his throne shall be most firm for ever. According to all these words, and according to all this vision, so spake Nathan to David. And when king David came, and sat before our Lord, he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Who am I Lord God, and what is my house, that thou shouldest give me such things? But this also hath seemed little in thy sight, and therefore thou hast spoken concerning the house of thy servant for time to come also: and hast made me renowned above all men Lord God. What can David add farther, whereas thou hast so glorified thy servant, and known him? Lord for thy servant according to thy heart thou hast done all this magnificence, and would have all thy great wonders to be known. Lord, there is not the like to thee: and there is none other beside thee, of all whom we have heard with our ears. For what other is there, as thy people Israel, one nation in the earth, to the which God went, to deliver it and make it his people, and with his greatness &amp; terrors cast out the nations before the face of it, which he delivered out of Aegypt? And thou hast made thy people Israel to be thy people for ever, and thou Lord art made the God thereof. Now therefore Lord, the word, which thou hast spoken to thy servant, and concerning his house, be it confirmed for ever, and do as thou hast spoken. And let thy name remain and be magnified for ever: and let it be said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The Lord of hosts is God of Israel, &amp; the house of David his servant permanent before him. For thou Lord my God hast revealed the ear of thy servant, to build him a house: and therefore thy servant hath found confidence, to pray before thee. Now therefore Lord thou art God: &amp; thou hast spoken to thy servant so great benefits. And thou hast begun to bless the house of thy servant, that it be always before thee: for thee o Lord blessing it, it shall be blessed for ever.</div>
