Onyx stones, and precious stones, for the adorning of the Ephod and the Rationale. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>And all the multitude of the children of Israel going forth from the sight of Moyses, offered first fruits to our Lord with a most prompt and devout mind, to make the work of the tabernacle of the testimony. Whatsoever was necessary to the service thereof and to the holy vestments, both men and women did give, tablets and earlets, rings and bracelets: every vessel of gold was separated for the donaries of our Lord. If any man had hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed red, and janthine skins, metal of silver and brass, they offered to our Lord, and the wood setim for diverse uses. But the skillful women also gave such things as they had spun, hyacinth, purple, and scarlet, and silk, and goats' hair, giving all of their own accord. But the Princes offered onyx stones, and precious stones, for the Ephod and the Rationale, and spices and oil to maintain the lights, and for the preparing of ointment, and to make the incense of most sweet savour. All men and women with devout mind offered donaries, that the works might be made which our Lord had commanded by the hand of Moyses. All the children of Israel did dedicate voluntary things to our Lord. And Moyses said to the children of Israel: Behold, our Lord hath called by name Beseleel the son of Uri the son of Hur of the tribe of Juda. And hath filled him with the spirit of God, with wisdom and intelligence, and science and all learning, to devise and to make work in gold and silver, and brass, and in graving stones, and in carpenter's work. Whatsoever can be devised artificially, he hath given in his heart: Ooliab also the son of Achisamech of the tribe of Dan: both hath he instructed with wisdom, to make the works of a carpenter, a tapester, an embroiderer of hyacinth and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, and silk, and to weave all things, and to invent all new things.</div>
