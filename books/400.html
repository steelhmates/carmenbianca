			<div class='roleText'>Twelve years old was Manasses when he began to reign, &amp; he reigned fifty five years in Jerusalem. And he did evil before our Lord, according to all the abominations of the nations, which our Lord overthrew before the children of Israel: and being turned, he re-edified the excelses which Ezechias his father had destroyed: and he built altars to Baalim, and made groves, and he adored all the host of heaven, &amp; worshipped it. He built also altars in the house of our Lord, whereof our Lord had said: </div>

And he built them to all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of our Lord: And he made his sons to pass through fire, to the Valebenennom: he observed dreams, followed soothsayings, gave himself to magic arts, he had with him magicians, and enchanters: and he wrought many evils before our Lord, to provoke him. Also a graven and a molten sign he put in the house of God, whereof our Lord spake to David, and to Salomon his son, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever, And I will not make the foot of Israel to move out of the land, which I have delivered to their fathers: yet so if they shall observe to do that I have commanded them, and all the law, and the ceremonies, and judgements by the hand of Moyses. Manasses therefore seduced Juda, &amp; the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that they did evil above all the nations, which our Lord had overthrown before the face of the children of Israel. And our Lord spake to him, and to his people, and they would not attend. Therefore he brought upon them the Princes of the host of the king of the Assyrians: and they took Manasses, and led him bound with chains, and fetters into Babylon. Who after that he was in distress, prayed our Lord his God: and did penance exceedingly before the God of his fathers. And he desired him, and besought him earnestly: and he heard his prayer, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his Kingdom, and Manasses knew that our Lord he was God. After these things he built a wall without the city of David, on the west of Gihon in the valley, from the entrance of the fish gate round about unto Ophel, and raised it exceedingly: and he appointed Princes of the host in all the fenced cities of Juda: and he took away strange gods, and the idol out of the house of our Lord: the altars also which he had made in the mount of the house of our Lord, and in Jerusalem, and he threw all without the city. Moreover he re-edified the altar of our Lord, and immolated upon it victims, and pacifics, and praise: and he commanded Juda to serve our Lord the God of Israel. Nevertheless as yet the people immolated in the excelses to our Lord their God. But the rest of the acts of Manasses: and his obsecration to his God: the words also of the Seers, that spake to him in the name of our Lord the God of Israel, are contained in the words of the kings of Israel. His prayer also, and his obtaining, and all his sins, and contempt, the places also wherein he built excelses, and made groves, and statues before he did penance, are written in the words of Hozai. Manasses therefore slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his house: and his son Amon reigned for him. Amon was two &amp; twenty years old when he began to reign, &amp; he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And he did evil in the sight of our Lord, as Manasses his father had done: &amp; he immolated to all the idols, which Manasses his father had made, and served them. And he did not reverence the face of our Lord, as Manasses his father did reverence it, and he committed far greater sins. And when his servants had conspired against him, they slew him in his own house. Moreover the rest of the multitude of the people, having slain them that struck Amon, made Josias his son king for him.</div>
