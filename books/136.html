			<div class='roleText'>This is the religion of the victim, which the Lord hath appointed. Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee a red cow of full age, wherein is no blemish, and that hath not carried yoke: and you shall deliver her to Eleazar the Priest, who bringing her forth without the camp, shall immolate her in the sight of all: and dipping his finger in her blood, shall sprinkle it against the doors of the tabernacle seven times, and shall burn her in the sight of all, committing as well her skin and the flesh, as the blood, and the dung to the fire. Wood also of the cedar, and hyssop, and scarlet twice dyed shall the Priest cast into the flame, that wasteth the cow. And then at length washing his garments, and his body, he shall enter into the camp, and shall be polluted until even. But he also that burneth her shall wash his garments and his body, and shall be unclean until even. And a man that is clean shall gather the ashes of the cow, and shall pour them out without the camp in a most clean place, that they may be reserved for the multitude of the children of Israel, and for water of aspersion: because the cow was burnt for sin. And when he that carried the ashes of the cow hath washed his garments, he shall be unclean until even. The children of Israel, and the strangers that dwell among them, shall have this for a holy thing by a perpetual ordinance. He that toucheth the dead corpse of a man, and is unclean therefore seven days, shall be sprinkled of this water the third day, and the seventh, and so shall be cleansed. If he were not sprinkled the third day, the seventh day he cannot be cleansed. Every one that toucheth the dead corpse of man's soul, and is not sprinkled with this commixtion, shall pollute the tabernacle of the Lord, and shall perish out of Israel: because he was not sprinkled with the water of expiation, he shall be unclean, and his filthiness shall remain upon him. This is the law of the man that dieth in a tabernacle: All that enter into his tent, and all the vessels that are there, shall be polluted seven days. The vessel, that hath no cover, nor binding over it, shall be unclean. If any man in the field touch the corpse of a man that was slain, or that died of himself, or his bone, or grave, he shall be unclean seven days. And they shall take of the ashes of combustion &amp; of sin, &amp; shall pour living water upon them into a vessel: in the which when a man that is clean hath dipped hyssop, he shall sprinkle therewith all the tent, and all the implements, and the men polluted with such contagion, and in this manner he that is clean shall purge the unclean the third and seventh day, And being expiated the seventh day, he shall wash both himself and his garments, and be unclean until evening. If any man be not expiated after this rite, his soul shall perish out of the midst of the Church: because he hath polluted the Lord's Sanctuary, and is not sprinkled with water of lustration. This precept shall be an ordinance for ever. He also that sprinkleth the waters, shall wash his garments: Every one that toucheth the waters of expiation, shall be unclean until even. Whatsoever he toucheth that is unclean he shall make it unclean: and the soul that toucheth any of these things, shall be unclean until even.</div>
