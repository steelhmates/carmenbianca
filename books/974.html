And in that time shall thy people be saved, every one that shall be found written in the book. And many of those, that sleep in the dust of the earth, shall awake: some unto life everlasting, &amp; others unto reproach to see it always. But they that be learned shall shine as the brightness of the firmament: and they that instruct many to justice, as stars unto perpetual eternities. But thou Daniel shut up the words, and seal the book, even to the time appointed: very many shall pass over, and there shall be manifest knowledge.

Many shall be chosen, and made white, &amp; shall be tried as fire: and the impious shall do impiously, neither shall all the impious understand, but the learned shall understand. And from the time when the continual sacrifice shall be taken away, and the abomination to desolation shall be set up, a thousand two hundred ninety days. Blessed is he that expecteth, and cometh unto days a thousand three hundred thirty five. But thou go, until the time prefixed: and thou shalt rest, and stand in thy lot unto the end of the days.</div>
