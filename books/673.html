			<div class='roleText'>Wisdom hath built herself an house, she hath cut out seven pillars. She hath immolated her victims, mingled her wine, and set forth her table. She hath sent her hand-maids to call to the tower, and to the walls of the city: If any be a little one, let him come to me. And to the unwise she spake: Come, eat ye my bread, &amp; drink the wine which I have mingled for you. Leave infancy, and live, and walk by the ways of prudence. He that teacheth a scorner doth injury to himself; and he that rebuketh the impious, purchaseth a blot to himself. Rebuke not the scorner lest he hate thee. Rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee. Give occasion to a wise man, and wisdom shall be added to him. Teach the just, and he shall make haste to take it. The beginning of wisdom, the fear of our Lord: and the knowledge of the holy, prudence. For by me shall thy days be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee. If thou be wise, to thyself thou shalt be: and if a scorner, thou alone shalt bear the evil. A foolish woman and clamorous, and full of allurements, and knowing nothing at all, sat in the doors of her house upon a seat in a high place of the city, to call them that pass by the way, and go on their journey: he that is a little one, let him turn to me. And to the fool she spake: Stolen waters are sweeter, and hidden bread more pleasant. And he was ignorant that giants are there, and her guests in the depths of hell.</div>
