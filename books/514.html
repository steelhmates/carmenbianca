			<div class='roleText'>And Job answering our Lord, said: I know that thou canst do all things, and no cogitation is hid from thee. Who is this, that concealeth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I spoken unwisely, and the things that did exceed my knowledge beyond measure. Hear (I beseech thee) and I will speak: I will ask thee, and do thou tell me. With the hearing of the ear I have heard thee, but now my eye seeth thee. Therefore I reprehend myself, and I do penance in imbers and ashes. And after our Lord spake these words to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Themanite: My fury is wrath against thee, and against thy two friends, because you have not spoken right before me, as my servant Job. Take therefore unto you seven oxen, and seven rams, &amp; go to my servant Job, and offer holocaust for yourselves: and my servant Job shall pray for you: his face I will receive, that the folly be not imputed to you: for you have not spoken right things before me, as my servant Job. Eliphaz therefore the Themanite, and Baldad the Suhite, and Sophar the Naamathite went, and did as our Lord had spoken to them, and our Lord received the face of Job. Our Lord also was turned at the penance of Job, when he prayed for his friends. And our Lord added all things whatsoever had been Job's, double. And all his brethren came to him, and all his sisters, and all that knew him before, and they did eat bread with him in his house: and wagged the head upon him, &amp; comforted him upon all the evil that God had brought in upon him. And every man gave him one ewe, and one earlet of gold. And our Lord blessed the last days of Job more than his beginning. And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she asses. And he had seven sons, and three daughters. And he called the name of one Dies, and the name of the second Cassia, and the name of the third Cornustibii. And there were not found in all the earth women so beautiful as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren. And Job lived after these things, an hundred forty years, and he saw his children, and his children's children, unto the fourth generation, and he died an old man, and full of days.</div>
