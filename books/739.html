			<div class='roleText'>Attend not to unjust possessions, and say not: I have sufficient livelihood: for it shall nothing profit in the time of vengeance &amp; affliction. Follow not in thy strength the concupiscence of thy heart: and say not: How mighty am I? And who shall bring me under for my facts? For God revenging will revenge. Say not: I have sinned, and what sorrowful thing hath chanced to me? For the Highest is a patient rewarder. Of sin forgiven be not without fear, neither add thou sin upon sin. And say not: The mercy of our Lord is great, he will have mercy on the multitude of my sins. For mercy and wrath quickly approach from God, and his wrath looketh upon sinners. Slack not to be converted to our Lord, and defer not from day to day. For his wrath shall come suddenly: and in the time of vengeance he will destroy thee. Be not careful in unjust riches: for they shall not profit thee in the day of obduction and vengeance. Toss not thyself into every wind, and go not into every way: for so every sinner is proved by a double tongue. Be steadfast in the way of our Lord, &amp; in the truth of thy understanding, and in knowledge, and let the word of peace and justice accompany thee. Be mild to hear the word, thou mayst understand, and with wisdom utter thou a true answer. If thou have understanding, answer thy neighbour: but if not, let thine hand be upon thy mouth, lest thou be taken in an unskillful word, and be confounded. Honour and glory in the word of the wise, but the tongue of the unwise is his subversion. Be not called a whisperer, and be not taken in thy tongue, &amp; confounded. For upon a thief is confusion &amp; repentance, and a very evil condemnation upon the double tongued, but to the whisperer hatred, and enmity, and contumely. Justify thou the little one, and the great alike.</div>
