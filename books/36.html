			<div class='roleText'>And these are the generations of Esau, the same is Edom. Esau took wives of the daughters of Chanaan: Ada the daughter of Elon the Hetheite, and Oolibama the daughter of Ana daughter of Sebeon the Heveite: Basemath also the daughter of Ismael sister of Nabajoth. And Ada bare Eliphaz: Basemath bare Rahuel: Oolibama bare Jehus and Ihelon and Core, these are the sons of Esau, that were born to him in the land of Chanaan. And Esau took his wives and sons and daughters, and every soul of his house, and his substance, and cattle, and all that he could have in the land of Chanaan: and he went into another country, and departed from his brother Jacob. For they were exceeding rich, and could not dwell together: neither was the land of their peregrination able to bear them, for the multitude of flocks. And Esau dwelt in Mount Seir, he is Edom. And these are the generations of Esau the father of Edom in mount Seir, and these are the names of his sons: Eliphaz the son of Ada the wife of Esau: Rahuel also the son of Basemath his wife. And Eliphas had sons: Theman, Omar, Sepho, and Gathan, and Cenes. And Thamna was the concubine of Eliphas the son of Esau: which bare to him Amalech. These are the sons of Ada the wife of Esau. And the sons of Rahuel were Nahath and Zara, Samma and Meza. These were the sons of Basemath the wife of Esau. These also were the sons of Oolibama, the daughter of Ana, the daughter of Sebeon, the wife of Esau, which she bare to him, Jehus, and Ihelon, and Core. These were Dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the first-begotten of Esau: Duke Theman, Duke Omar, Duke Sepho, Duke Cenes, Duke Core, Duke Gatham, Duke Amalech, these are the sons of Eliphaz in the land of Edom, &amp; these are the sons of Ada. These also were the sons of Rahuel, the son of Esau: Duke Nahath, Duke Zara, Duke Samma, Duke Meza. And these be the Dukes of Rahuel, in the Land of Edom: these be the sons of Basemath the wife of Esau. And these were the sons of Oolibama the wife of Esau: Duke Jehus, Duke Ihelon, Duke Core. These be the Dukes of Oolibama, the daughter of Ana, and wife of Esau. These are the sons of Esau, and these are the Dukes of them: the same is Edom. These are the sons of Seir the Horreite, the inhabiters of the land: Lotan, and Sobal, and Sebeon, and Ana, and Dison, and Eser, and Disan. These are Dukes of the Horreite, the sons of Seir in the Land of Edom. And Lotan had sons: Hori and Heman. And the sister of Lotan was Thamna. And these were the sons of Sobal: Alvan and Manahat, and Ebal, and Sepho, and Onam. And these were the sons of Sebeon: Aia and Ana. This is Ana that found the hot waters in the wilderness, when he fed the asses of Sebeon his father: and he had a son Dison, and a daughter Oolibama. And these were the sons of Dison: Hamdan, and Eseban, and Iethram, and Charan. These also were the sons of Eser: Balaan, and Zavan, and Acan. And Disan had sons: Hus, and Aram. These were Dukes of the Horreites: Duke Lotan, Duke Sobal, Duke Sebeon, Duke Ana, Duke Dison, Duke Eser, Duke Disan: these were Dukes of the Horreites that ruled in the Land Seir. And the kings that ruled in the land of Edom, before that the children of Israel had a king, were these: Bela the son of Beor, and the name of his city Denaba. And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zara of Bosra reigned in his stead. And when Jobab was dead, Husam of the land of the Themans reigned in his stead. He also being dead, there reigned in his stead Adad the son of Badad, that struck Madian in the country of Moab: and the name of his city was Avith. And when Adad was dead, there reigned for him Semla of Masreca. He also being dead, Saul of the river Rohoboth, reigned in his stead. And when he also was dead, Balanan the son of Achobor succeeded into the Kingdom. This men also being dead Adar reigned in his place, and the name of his city was Phau: and his wife was called Meetabel, the daughter of Matred, daughter of Mezaab.
