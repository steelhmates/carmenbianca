			<div class='roleText'>But the children of Israel transgressed the commandment, and usurped of the anathema: For Achan the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare of the tribe of Juda, took somewhat of the anathema: and our Lord was angry against the children of Israel. And when Josue sent from Jericho men against Hai, which is beside Bethaven, at the East side of the town of Bethel, he said to them: Go up, and view the Land: who accomplishing his commandments, viewed Hai. and returning they said to him: Let not all the people go up, but let two or three thousand men go, and destroy the city: why shall all the people be vexed in vain against very few enemies? There went up therefore three thousand fighting men. Who immediately turning their backs, were strucken of the men of the city of Hai, and there fell of them six and thirty men: and the adversaries pursued them from the gate as far as Sabarim, and they struck them flying away by the descent: and the heart of the people was much afraid, and melted like unto water. But Josue rent his garments, and fell flat on the ground before the ark of our Lord until evening, as well he as all the ancients of Israel: and they cast dust upon their heads, and Josue said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Alas, o Lord God, why wouldst thou bring this people over the river of Jordan, to deliver us into the hands of the Amorrhite, &amp; to destroy us? Would God as we began, we had tarried beyond Jordan. My Lord God what shall I say, seeing Israel turning their backs to their enemies. The Chananites shall hear of it, &amp; all the inhabitants of the Land, and being gathered together in a plump shall compass us about, &amp; shall destroy our name from the earth: and what wilt thou do to thy great name? And our Lord said to Josue: Arise^ why liest thou flat on the ground? Israel hath sinned, and transgressed my covenant: and they have taken of the anathema, and have stolen and lied, and have hid it among their vessels. Neither can Israel stand before his enemies, and he shall fly them: because he is polluted with the anathema. I will be no more with you, till you dispatch him, that is guilty of this wicked fact. Arise, sanctify the people, and say to them: Be sanctified against tomorrow, for thus saith our Lord God of Israel: There is anathema in the midst of thee, o Israel: thou canst not stand before thine enemies, till he be destroyed out of thee that is contaminated with this wicked fact. And you shall come in the morning every one by your tribes: and what tribe soever the lot shall find, it shall come by the kindreds thereof, the kindred by the houses, &amp; the house by the men. And whosoever he be that shall be taken in this fact, he shall be burnt in the fire with all his substance, because he hath transgressed the covenant of our Lord, &amp; hath done abomination in Israel. Josue therefore rising in the morning, made Israel to come by their tribes, and it was found the tribe of Juda. Which being presented by the families thereof, it was found the family of Zare. Presenting that also by the houses, he found it Zabdi: Whose house dividing into every man, he found Achan the son of Charmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zare of the tribe of Juda. And Josue said to Achan: My son, give glory to our Lord God of Israel, and confess, and tell me what thou hast done, hide it not. And Achan answered Josue, &amp; said to him: Indeed I have sinned to our Lord the God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done. For I saw among the spoils a cloak of scarlet very good, and two hundred sicles of silver, and a golden rule of fifty sicles: and coveting I took it away, and hid it in the ground against the midst of my tabernacle, and the silver I covered with the earth digged up. Josue therefore sent ministers: who running to his tabernacle found all things hid in the same place, and the silver withal. And taking it away out of the tent, brought it to Josue, and to all the children of Israel, and threw it before our Lord. Josue therefore taking Achan the son of Zare, and the silver and the cloak, and the golden rule, his sons also and daughters, his oxen, and asses, and sheep, and the tabernacle it-self, and all the stuff: (and all Israel with him) they brought them to the valley of Achor: Where Josue said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Because thou hast disturbed us, our Lord disturb thee in this day. And all Israel stoned him: and all things that were his, were consumed with fire. And they gathered together upon him a great heap of stones, which remaineth until this present day. And the fury of our Lord was averted from them. And the name of that place was called, the valley of Achor, until this day.</div>
