			<div class='roleText'>PAUL and Sylvanus and Timothee to the Church of the Thessalonians in God the Father, and our Lord JESUS Christ. Grace to you and peace. We give thanks to God always for all you; making a memory of you in prayers without intermission, mindful of the work of your faith and labour, and of the charity, &amp; of the enduring of the hope of our Lord JESUS Christ, before God and our Father: knowing, brethren beloved of God, your election: that our Gospel hath not been to you in word only, but in power &amp; the Holy Ghost, &amp; in much fullness, as you know what manner of men we have been among you for your sakes. And you became followers of us, &amp; of our Lord; receiving the word in much tribulation, with joy of the Holy Ghost: so that you were made a pattern to all that believe in Macedonia &amp; in Achaia. For from you was bruited the word of our Lord: not only in Macedonia and in Achaia, but also in every place, your faith which is to God-ward, is proceeded, so that it is not necessary for us to speak any thing. For they themselves report of us what manner of entering we had to you; and how you are turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God, and to expect his Son from Heaven (whom he raised up from the dead) JESUS, who hath delivered us from the wrath to come.</div>
