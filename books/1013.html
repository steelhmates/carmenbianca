			<div class='roleText'>Hear ye what our Lord speaketh: Arise, contend in judgement against the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice. Let the mountains hear the judgement of our Lord, and the strong foundations of the earth: because the judgement of our Lord is with his people, and with Israel he will be judged. My people what have I done to thee, or what have I molested thee? Answer me. Because I brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt, and delivered thee out of the house of them that served: and sent before thy face Moyses, and Aaron, and Mary? My people remember I pray thee, what Balach the king of Moab purposed: and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him: from Setim even to Galgal, that thou mightest know the justices of our Lord. What worthy thing shall I offer to our Lord? Shall I bow the knee to the high God? What shall I offer unto him holocausts, and calves of a year old? Why, can our Lord be pacified with thousands of rams, or with many thousands of fat buckgoats? Why, shall I give my first born for my wickedness, the fruit of my womb for the sin of my soul? I will shew thee o man what is good, and what our Lord requireth of thee: Verily to do judgement, and to love mercy, and to walk solicitous with thy God. The voice of our Lord cryeth to the city, and salvation shall be to them that fear thy name: hear ye o tribes, and who shall approve it? As yet there is fire in the house of the impious, treasures of iniquity, and a lesser measure full of wrath. Why, shall I justify an impious balance, and the deceitful weights of the bag? By which her richmen were replenished with iniquity, and the inhabitants therein spake lies, and their tongue was fraudulent in their mouth. And I therefore began to strike thee with perdition for thy sins. Thou shalt eat, and shalt not be filled: and thy humiliation in the midst of thee: and thou shalt apprehend, and shalt not save: &amp; whom thou shalt save, I will give unto the sword. Thou shalt sow, and shalt not reap: thou shalt tread the olive, and shalt not be anointed with the oil: and press muste, and shalt not drink the wine. And thou hast kept the precepts of Amri, and all the work of the house of Achab: &amp; thou hast walked in their wills, that I might give thee into perdition, and the inhabitants therein into hissing, and the reproach of my people you shall bear.</div>
