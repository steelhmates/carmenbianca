And the excelses of the idol shall be thrown down, and the sanctifications of Israel shall be made desolate: and I will rise upon the house of Jeroboam with the sword. And Amasias the Priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam the king of Israel, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Amos hath rebelled against thee in the midst of the house of Israel: the land will not be able to sustain all his words. For thus saith Amos: Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall depart captive out of their land. And Amasias said to Amos: Thou that seest, go, fly into the land of Juda: and eat bread there, and thou shalt prophesy there. And in Bethel thou shalt add no more to prophesy: because it is the sanctification of the king, and it is the house of the kingdom. And Amos answered, and said to Amasias: I am not a Prophet and I am not the son of a Prophet: but an herdsman am I plucking sycamores. And our Lord took me when I followed the flock, and our Lord said to me: Go, Prophesy to my people Israel. And now hear the word of our Lord: Thou sayest: Thou shalt not prophesy upon Israel, and thou shalt not distill upon the house of the idol. Therefore thus saith our Lord: Thy wife shall fornicate in the city, and thy sons, and thy daughters shall fall by the sword, and thy ground shall be measured with a cord, and thou shalt die in a polluted land, and Israel shall depart captive out of their land.</div>
