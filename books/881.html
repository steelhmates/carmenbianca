			<div class='roleText'>Write unto thee all the words that I have spoken to thee, in a book. For behold the days come, saith our Lord: and I will convert the conversion of my people Israel and Juda, saith our Lord: and I will make them return to the land, which I gave their fathers, &amp; they shall possess it. And these are the words, that our Lord hath spoken to Israel and to Juda: Because thus saith our Lord: We have heard a voice of terror: there is fear and no peace. Demand, and see if a man bear child? Wherefore then have I seen every man's hand upon his loin, as a woman that is in travail, and all faces are turned into the jaundice? Alas, because that is a great day, neither is there the like to it: and it is the time of tribulation to Jacob, &amp; he shall be saved out of it. And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord of hosts: I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will break his bands: &amp; strangers shall no more rule over him: but they shall serve our Lord their God, &amp; David their king, whom I will raise up to them. Thou therefore my servant Jacob fear not, saith our Lord, neither be thou afraid Israel: because lo I will save thee out of a far country, and thy seed out of the land of their captivity: &amp; Jacob shall return, and be at rest, &amp; flow with all good things, &amp; there shall be none whom he may fear: because I am with thee, saith our Lord, to save thee: for I will make a consummation in all the Nations, in which I have dispersed thee: but thee I will not make into consummation: but I will chastise thee in judgement, that thou mayst not seem to thyself innocent. Because thus saith our Lord: Thy wound is uncurable, thy stripe is very sore. There is none to judge thy judgement to bind it up: there is no profit of medicines for thee. All thy lovers have forgotten thee, &amp; will not seek thee: for with the stroke of an enemy I have strucken thee with cruel chastisement: for the multitude of thine iniquity, thy sins are hardened. What cryest thou upon thine affliction? Thy sorrow is uncurable: for the multitude of thine iniquity, &amp; for thine hardened sins I have done these things to thee. Therefore all that eat thee, shall be devoured: and all thine enemies shall be led into captivity: and they that waste thee, shall be wasted, and all thy spoilers will I give to the spoil. For I will close up thy wound, and will heal thee of thy wounds, saith our Lord. Because they have called thee, o Sion, an outcast: This is she, that had none to seek after her. Thus saith our Lord: Behold I will convert the conversion of the tabernacles of Jacob, and will have pity on his houses, &amp; the city shall be built in her high place, and the temple shall be founded according to the order thereof. And out of them shall come forth praise, and the voice of them that play: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be diminished: and I will glorify them, and they shall not be lessened. And his children shall be as from the beginning, and his assembly shall be permanent before me: and I will visit against all that afflict him. And his duke shall be of himself: and the prince shall be brought forth from the midst of him: and I will bring him near, and he shall come to me. For who is this, that applieth his heart to approach unto me, saith our Lord? And you shall be my people: and I will be your God. Behold, the whirlwind of our Lord, the fury going forth, the storm violently falling, it shall light upon the head of the impious. Our Lord will not turn away the wrath of indignation, till he have done and accomplished the cogitation of his heart: in the latter days you shall understand these things.</div>
