			<div class='roleText'>The burden of Ninive. The Book of the vision of Nahum the Elceseite. God is jealous, &amp; our Lord revenging, our Lord revenging, and having fury: our Lord revenging on his adversaries, and he is angry with his enemies. Our Lord is patient, and great of strength, and cleansing, he will not make innocent. Our Lord's ways in tempest, &amp; whirlwind, &amp; clouds, the dust of his feet. Rebuking the sea, &amp; drying it up: &amp; bringing all rivers to a desert. Basan is weakened &amp; Carmel: &amp; the flower of Libanus is faded. The mountains were moved at him, and the hills were desolate: and the earth hath trembled at his presence, &amp; the world, &amp; all that dwell therein. Before the face of his indignation who shall stand? &amp; who shall resist in the wrath of his fury? His indignation is poured out as fire: and the rocks are dissolved by him. Our Lord is good, &amp; strengthening in the day of tribulation: &amp; knowing them that hope in him. And in a flood passing by, he will make a consummation of the place thereof: &amp; darkness shall pursue his enemies. What think ye against our Lord? Consummation he will make: there shall not rise double tribulation. Because as thorns clasp one another: so the feast of them that drink together: they shall be consumed as stubble full of dryness. Out of thee shall come forth one that thinketh malice against our Lord in the mind devising prevarication. Thus saith our Lord: If they shall be perfect: and so a great many, so also shall they be shorn, and he shall pass by: I have afflicted thee, and I will afflict thee no more. And now I will break his rod from off thy back, &amp; I will burst thy bonds in sunder. And Our Lord will command upon thee, there shall not be sown of thy name any more: out of the house of thy God I will destroy sculptile, &amp; molten, I will put thy grave, because thou art dishonoured. Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that Evangelizeth, and preacheth peace: celebrate, o Juda, thy festivities, and render thy vows: because Belial shall no more add to pass through thee, he is wholly perished.</div>
