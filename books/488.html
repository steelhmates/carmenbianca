			<div class='roleText'>But Job answering said: I have heard oftentimes such things, heavy comforters you are all. Shall words full of wind have an end? Or is any thing troublesome to thee, if thou speak? I also could speak things like to you: and would God your soul were for my soul. I also would comfort you with words, and would wag my head upon you. I would strengthen you with my mouth, and would move my lips, as sparing you. But what shall I do? If I speak, my pain will not rest: and if I hold my peace, it will not depart from me. But now my sorrow hath oppressed me, &amp; all my limbs are brought to nothing. My wrinkles give testimony against me, and a false speaker is raised up against my face contradicting me. He hath gathered his fury upon me, and threatening me hath gnashed against me with his teeth, mine enemy hath beheld me with terrible eyes. They have opened their mouths upon me, and exprobating have strucken my cheek, they are filled with my pains. God hath shut me up with the wicked man, and hath delivered me to the hands of the impious. I sometime that wealthy-one suddenly am broken: he hath held my neck, broken me, and set me to himself as it were a mark. He hath compassed me with his spears, he hath wounded my loins, he hath not spared, and hath poured out on the earth my bowels. He hath cut me with wound upon wound, he hath come violently upon me as it were a giant. I have sowed sackcloth upon my skin, and have covered my flesh with ashes. My face is swollen with weeping, and my eye-lids are dim. These things have I suffered without the iniquity of my hand, whereas I had clean prayers to God. Earth cover not my blood, neither let my cry find place in thee to be hid. For behold my witness is in heaven, and he that knoweth my conscience on high. My friends full of words: mine eye distilleth unto God. And would God a man might so be judged with God, as the son of man is judged with his companion. For behold the short years pass away, and I walk the path, by the which I shall not return.</div>
