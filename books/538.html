			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, the Psalm of David. To thee, O Lord, I have lifted up my soul: my God in thee is my confidence, let me not be ashamed. Neither let mine enemies scorn me: for all that expect thee, shall not be confounded. Let all be confounded that do unjust things in vain. Lord shew me thy ways: and teach me thy paths. Direct me in thy truth, and teach me: because thou art God my Saviour, and thee have I expected all the day. Remember, O Lord, thy commiserations, and thy mercies: that are from the beginning of the world. The sins of my youth, and my ignorances do not remember. According to thy mercy remember thou me: for thy goodness, O Lord. Our Lord is sweet, and righteous: for this cause he will give a law to them that sin in the way. He will direct the mild in judgment: he will teach the meek his ways. All the ways of our Lord be mercy and truth, to them that seek after his testament and his testimonies. For thy name, o Lord, thou wilt be propitious to my sin: for it is much. Who is the man that feareth our Lord? He appointeth him a law in the way that he hath chosen. His soul shall abide in good things: and his seed shall inherit the land. Our Lord is a firmament to them that fear him: &amp; his testament that it may be made manifest to them. Mine eyes are always to our Lord: because he will pluck my feet out of the snare. Have respect to me, and have mercy on me: because I am alone and poor. The tribulations of my heart are multiplied: deliver me from my necessities. See my humiliation and my labour, and forgive all my sins. Behold mine enemies, because they are multiplied, and with unjust hatred hated me. Keep my soul, and deliver me: I shall not be ashamed, because I hoped in thee. The innocent and righteous have cleaved to me: because I expected thee. Deliver Israel, o God, out of all his tribulations.</div>
