			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Sing ye to our Lord a new song: let his praise be in the Church of saints. Let Israel be joyful in him, that made him: and let the children of Sion rejoice in their King. Let them praise his name in choir: on timbrel and psalter let them sing to him. Because our Lord is well pleased in his people: and he will exalt the meek unto salvation. The saints shall rejoice in glory: they shall be joyful in their beds. The exaltations of God in their throat: and two edged swords in their hands. To do revenge in the nations: chastisements among the peoples. To bind their kings in fetters: and their nobles in iron manacles. That they may do in them the judgement that is written: this glory is to all his saints. Alleluia.</div>
