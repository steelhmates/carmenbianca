			<div class='roleText'>PAUL and Sylvanus and Timothee, to the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and our Lord JESUS Christ. Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord JESUS Christ. We ought to give thanks always to God for you, brethren, so as meet is, because your faith increaseth exceedingly, and the charity of every one of you aboundeth towards each other: so that we ourselves also glory in you in the churches of God, for your patience, and faith in all your persecutions and tribulations, which you sustain for an example of the just judgement of God, that you may be counted worthy of the Kingdom of God, for the which also you suffer. If yet it be just with God to repay tribulation, to them that vex you: and to you that are vexed, rest with us in the revelation of our Lord JESUS from Heaven with the Angels of his power, in flame of fire, giving revenge to them that know not God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord JESUS Christ. Who shall suffer eternal pains in destruction, from the face of our Lord and from the glory of his power: when he shall come to be glorified in his saints, and to be made marvelous in all them that have believed, because our testimony concerning you was credited in that day. Wherein also we pray always for you, that our God make you worthy of his vocation, and accomplish all the good pleasure of his goodness &amp; the work of faith in power, that the name of our Lord JESUS Christ may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God, and of our Lord JESUS Christ.</div>
