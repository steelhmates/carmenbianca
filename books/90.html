			<div class='roleText'>The first month, the first day of the month, thou shalt erect the tabernacle of the testimony, &amp; shalt put in it the ark, and shalt let down before it the veil: &amp; bringing in the table, thou shalt set upon it the things that are commanded after the rite. The candlestick shall stand with the lamps thereof, and the altar of gold whereon the incense is burned, before the ark of testimony. Thou shalt put the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle, and before it the altar of holocaust: the laver between the altar and the tabernacle, which thou shalt fill with water. And thou shalt compass about the court with hangings, &amp; the entry thereof. And taking the oil of unction thou shalt anoint the tabernacle with the vessels thereof, that they may be sanctified: the altar of holocaust and all the vessels thereof: the laver with the foot thereof; all shalt thou consecrate with the oil of unction, that they may be most Holy. And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of testimony, and having washed them with water, thou shalt revest them with the sacred vestments, that they may minister to me, and the unction of them may prosper to an everlasting priesthood. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>And Moyses did all things which our Lord had commanded. Therefore the first month of the second year, the first day of the month, the tabernacle was placed. And Moyses erected it, and put the boards and feet and bars, and reared the pillars, and spread the roof over the tabernacle, putting over it a cover, as our Lord had commanded. He put also the testimony in the ark, thrusting bars underneath, and the oracle above. And when he had brought the ark into the tabernacle, he drew before it the veil to fulfill the commandment of our Lord. He set the table also in the tabernacle of testimony at the north side without the veil, ordering the bread of proposition before it, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. He set the candlestick also in the tabernacle of testimony over against the table on the south side, placing the lamps in order, according to the precept of our Lord. He set also the altar of gold under the roof of testimony against the veil, and burned upon it the incense of spices, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. He put also the hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of testimony, and the altar of holocaust in the entry of the testimony, offering on it the holocaust, and the sacrifices, as our Lord had commanded. The laver also he set between the tabernacle of testimony and the altar, filling it with water. And Moyses and Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet, when they entered the roof of covenant, and went to the altar, as our Lord had commanded Moyses. He erected also the court, round about the tabernacle and the altar, drawing the hanging in the entry thereof. After all things were perfited, the cloud covered the tabernacle of testimony, and the glory of our Lord filled it. Neither could Moyses enter the roof of covenant, the cloud covering all things, and the majesty of our Lord shining, because the cloud had covered all things. If at any time the cloud did leave the tabernacle, the children of Israel went forward by their troops: If it hung over, they remained in the same place. For the cloud of our Lord hung over the tabernacle by day, and fire by night, in the sight of all the children of Israel throughout all their mansions.</div>
