			<div class='roleText'>My beloved is gone down into the garden, to the bed of aromatical spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies. I to my beloved, and my beloved to me, who feedeth among the lilies. Thou art fair o my love, sweet, and comely as Jerusalem: terrible as the army of a camp set in array. Turn away thine eyes from me, because they have made me fly away. Thy hairs as a flock of goats, which have appeared from Galaad. Thy teeth as a flock of sheep, which have come up from the lavatory, all with twins, and there is no barren among them. As the bark of a pomegranate, so are thy cheeks, beside thy hidden. There are threescore queens, &amp; fourscore concubines, and of young maids there is no number. My dove is one, my perfect one, she is the only of her mother, elect to her that bare her. The daughters have seen her, and declared her to be most blessed: the queens and concubines, and have praised her. What is she, that cometh forth as the morning rising, fair as the moon, elect as the sun, terrible as the army of a camp set in array? I came down into the garden of nuts, to see the fruits of the valleys, and to look if the vineyard had flourished, and the pomegranates budded. I knew not: my soul troubled me for the chariots of Aminadab. Return, return o Sulamitess: return, return, that we may behold thee.</div>
