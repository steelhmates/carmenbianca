But I know that the king of Aegypt will not dismiss you to go but by mighty hand. For I will stretch forth my hand, and will strike Aegypt in all my marvels, which I will do in the midst of them: after these he will dismiss you. And I will give grace to this people in the sight of the Aegyptians: and when you shall go forth, you shall not depart empty: but each woman shall ask of her neighbour and of her that is in house with her^ vessels of silver and of gold, and raiment: and you shall lay it upon your sons and daughters, and shall spoil Aegypt.</div>
