			<div class='roleText'>In the third month of the departure of Israel out of the Land of Aegypt, this day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. For departing out of Raphidim, and coming to the desert of Sinai, they camped in the same place, &amp; there Israel pitched their tents over against the mountain. And Moyses went up to God: and our Lord called him from the mountain, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and shalt tell the children of Israel: Yourselves have seen what I have done to the Aegyptians, how I have carried you upon the wings of eagles, and have taken you unto me. If therefore you will hear my voice, and keep my covenant, you shall be my peculiar of all peoples: for all the earth is mine. And you shall be unto me a Priestly Kingdom, and a holy nation: these are the words that thou shalt speak to the children of Israel. </div>

And thou shalt appoint certain limits to the people in circuit, and shalt say to them: Beware ye ascend not into the mount, &amp; that you touch not the ends thereof: every one that toucheth the mount, dying shall die. Hand shall not touch him, but he shall be stoned to death, or shall be shot through with arrows: whether it be beast, or man, it shall not live. When the trumpet shall begin to sound, then let them ascend into the mount. </div>

And when Moyses had brought them forth to meet with God from the place of the camp, they stood at the bottom of the mount. And all the mount Sinai smoked: for because our Lord was descended upon it in fire, and the smoke arose from it as out of a furnace: and all the mount was terrible. And the sound of the trumpet grew louder by little and little, and was drawn out a length: Moyses spake, and God answered him. And our Lord descended upon the mount Sinai in the very top of the mount, and he called Moyses into the top thereof. Whither when he was ascended, he said unto him: </div>
