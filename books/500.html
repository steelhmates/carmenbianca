			<div class='roleText'>Silver hath beginnings of her veins, and gold hath a place, wherein it is molten. Iron is taken out of the earth, &amp; stone resolved with heat, is turned into brass. He hath set a time for darkness, &amp; the end of all things he considereth, the stone also of darkness, and the shadow of death. The torrent divideth from the pilgrim people, them whom the foot of the needy man hath forgotten, and to whom there is no way. The land, out of which bread grew in his place, is destroyed with fire. The place of the sapphire the stones thereof, and the clods of it gold. The bird hath not known the path, neither hath the eye of the vulture beheld it. The children of merchants have not trodden it, neither hath the lioness passed by it. He hath stretched forth his hand to the flint, he hath overthrown mountains from the roots. In the rocks he hath cut out rivers, and his eye hath seen every precious thing. The depths also of rivers he hath searched, &amp; hid things he hath brought forth to light: But where is wisdom to be found, and what is the place of understanding? Man knoweth not the price thereof, neither is it found in the land of them that live pleasantly. The depth saith: It is not in me: and the sea speaketh: It is not with me. The finest gold shall not be given for it, neither shall silver be weighed in the change thereof. It shall not be compared with the dyed colours of India, nor with Sardonyx the most precious stone, or with the Sapphire. Gold or glass shall not be equal to it, neither shall vessels of gold be changed for it. High and eminent things shall not be mentioned in comparison of it: and wisdom is drawn out of secret places. The topazius of Aethiopia shall not be equal to it, neither shall it be compared to the cleanest dying. From whence then cometh wisdom? And what is the place of understanding? It is hid from the eyes of all living, the fowls of the air also know it not. Perdition &amp; death have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>With our ears we have heard the fame thereof. God understandeth the way of it, &amp; he knoweth the place thereof. For he beholdeth the ends of the world, &amp; looketh on all things that are under heaven. Who made a poise to the winds, &amp; weighed the waters in a measure. When he gave a law to the rains, &amp; a way to the sounding storms. Then he saw it, and declared, and prepared, and searched it. And he said to man: Behold the fear of our Lord, that is wisdom: and to depart from evil, understanding.</div>
