			<div class='roleText'>Therefore the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also the king of Basan, and all his people: and we struck them to utter destruction, wasting all his cities at one time. There was not a town that escaped us: sixty cities, all the country of Argob the Kingdom of Og in Basan. All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates and bars, beside innumerable towns that had no walls. And we destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon, destroying every city, and men and women and children: but the cattle, and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey. And we took at that time the land out of the hand of two kings of the Amorrheites, that were beyond Jordan: from the torrent Arnon unto the mountain Hermon. which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrheites Sanir: all the cities, that are situated in the plain, and all the Land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha, and Edrai, cities of the Kingdom of Og in Basan. For only Og the king of Basan remained of the stock of giants. His bed of iron is shewed, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, having nine cubits in length, and four in breadth after the measure of the cubit of a man's hand. And we possessed the Land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Arnon, unto the half part of mount Galaad: and the cities thereof I gave to Ruben and Gad. And the other part of Galaad, and all Basan of the kingdom of Og, I delivered to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants. Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan by his own name, </div>

			<div class='roleText'>that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day. To Machir also I gave Galaad. And to the tribes of Ruben and Gad I gave of the Land of Galaad as far as the Torrent Arnon, half of the torrent, and the confines unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon: and the plain of the wilderness, and Jordan, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is most salt, at the foot of mount Phasga against the east. And I commanded you at that time, saying: The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel all you strong men: except your wives, and little ones, and your cattle. For I know you have much cattle, &amp; they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered you, until our Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you: and they also possess the Land, which he will give them beyond Jordan: then shall every man return to his possession, which I have given you. Josue also at that time I commanded, saying: Thine eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings: so will he do to all the kingdoms, to the which thou shalt pass. Fear them not: for the Lord your God will fight for you. And I prayed our Lord at that time, saying: Lord God thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand. For neither is there other God either in heaven, or in earth, that is able to do thy works, and to be compared to thy strength. I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent Land beyond Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus. And our Lord was angry with me for you, and heard me not, but said to me: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>It sufficeth thee: speak no more to me of this matter. Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thine eyes round about to the west, and to the north, and the south, and the east, and behold it. For thou shalt not pass this Jordan. Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him: for he shall go before this people, and shall divide unto them the Land, which thou shalt see. </div>
