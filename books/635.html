			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. I rejoiced in these things, which were said to me: We shall go into the house of our Lord. Our feet were standing, in thy courts, o Jerusalem. Jerusalem, which is built as a city: whose participation is together in it-self. For thither did the tribes ascend, the tribes of our Lord: the testimony of Israel to confess unto the name of our Lord. Because seats sat there in judgment, seats upon the house of David. Ask ye the things that are for the peace of Jerusalem: and aboundance to them that love thee. Peace be made in thy strength: and aboundance in thy towers. For my brethren, and my neighbours' sakes, I spake peace of thee: For the house of our Lord God, I have sought good things to thee.</div>
