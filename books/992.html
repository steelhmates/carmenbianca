			<div class='roleText'>Sound ye with the trumpet in Sion, howl in my holy mount, let all the inhabitants of the land be troubled: Because the day of our Lord cometh, because the day of darkness, and of mist is near, the day of cloud, &amp; whirlwind: as the morning spread upon the mountains much people &amp; strong: the like to it hath not been from the beginning, and after it shall not be even unto the years of generation &amp; generation. Before the face thereof a devouring fire, &amp; after it a burning flame: the land before it as it were a garden of pleasure, and after it the wilderness of a desert, neither is there that can escape it. As the appearance of horses, their appearance, &amp; as horsemen so shall they run. As the sound of chariots upon the tops of mountains shall they leap, as the sound of a flame of fire devouring stubble, as a strong people prepared to battle. At his presence the people shall be vexed: all visages shall be made like a pot. They shall run as valiants: as men of war they shall scale the wall: the men shall march in their ways, &amp; shall not decline from their paths. None shall press his brother: they shall walk every one in their own path: yea &amp; through the windows they shall fall, &amp; shall not demolish. They shall enter the city: they shall run on the wall, they shall climb the houses, by the windows they shall enter as a thief. At his presence the earth hath trembled, the heavens are moved: the sun and moon are darkened, and the stars have withdrawn their shining. And our Lord hath given his voice before the face of his host: because his camps are exceeding many, because strong &amp; doing his word: for great is the day of our Lord, and terrible exceedingly: &amp; who shall sustain it? Now therefore saith our Lord: Convert to me in all your heart, in fasting, &amp; in weeping, and in mourning. And rent your hearts, and not your garments, &amp; turn to the Lord your God: because he is benign &amp; merciful, patient and of much mercy, &amp; ready to be gracious upon the malice. Who knoweth if he will convert, &amp; forgive, and leave after him benediction, sacrifice, and libament to the Lord your God? Sound ye with the trumpet in Sion, sanctify a fast, call an assembly, gather together the people, sanctify the Church, assemble the ancients, gather together the little ones, &amp; them that suck the breasts: let the bridegroom go forth to his chamber, &amp; the bride out of her bride-chamber. Between the porch &amp; the altar the priests our Lord's ministers shall weep, &amp; shall say: Spare o Lord, spare thy people: and give not thine inheritance into reproach, that the nations have dominion over them. Why say they in the peoples: Where is their God? Our Lord hath been zealous to his land, &amp; hath spared his people. And our Lord answered, and said to his people: Behold I will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and you shall be replenished with them: &amp; I will give you no more to be a reproach in the Gentiles. And him that is from the North, I will make far from you: &amp; I will expel him into a land unpassable, &amp; desert, his face against the east sea, &amp; his extreme part to the last sea: &amp; his stink shall ascend, &amp; his rottenness shall ascend, because he hath done proudly. Fear not o land, rejoice &amp; be glad: because our Lord hath magnified to do. Fear not ye beasts of the region: because the beautiful things of the desert are sprung, because the tree hath brought his fruit, the fig-tree, &amp; the vine have given their vigour. And ye children of Sion rejoice, &amp; be joyful in the Lord your God: because he hath given you a Doctor of justice, &amp; he will make the early and the late shower to descend to you as in the beginning. And the floors shall be filled with wheat, and the presses shall overflow with wine and oil. And I will render you the years, which the locust, the bruke, and the blast, and the eruke hath eaten: my great strength which I have sent upon you. And you shall eat eating, and shall be filled: and you shall praise the name of the Lord your God, that hath done marvels with you, and my people shall not be confounded for ever. And you shall know that I am in the midst of Israel: &amp; I^ the Lord your God, and there is none besides: and my people shall not be confounded for ever. And it shall be after this: I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh: and your sons, and your daughters shall prophesy: your ancients shall dream dreams, and your young men shall see visions. Yea and upon my servants, and handmaids in those days I will pour out my spirit. And I will give wonders in heaven, and in earth, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke. The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood: before the great and horrible day of the Lord doth come. And it shall be, every one that shall invocate the name of the Lord, shall be saved: because in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem shall be salvation, as our Lord hath said, and in the residue whom our Lord shall call.</div>
