			<div class='roleText'>AND concerning the collections that are made for the Saints, as I have ordained to the Churches of Galatia, so do ye also. In the first of the Sabboth let every one of you put a part with himself, laying up what shall well like him: that not when I come, then collections be made. And when I shall be present; whom you shall approve by letters, them will I send to carry your grace into Jerusalem. And if it be worthy that I also go, they shall go with me. And I will come to you, when I shall have passed through Macedonia. For I will pass through Macedonia. And with you perhaps I will abide, or will winter also: that you may bring me on my way whithersoever I go. For I will not now see you by the way, for I hope that I shall abide with you some little time, if our Lord will permit. But I will tarry at Ephesus until Pentecost. For a great door and evident is opened unto me: and many adversaries. And if Timothee come, see that he be without fear with you, for he worketh the work of our Lord, as also I. Let no man therefore despise him, but conduct ye him in peace: that he may come to me. For I expect him with the brethren. And of brother Apollo I do you to understand, that I much entreated him to come unto you with the brethren: and at all it was not his mind to come now. But he will come when he shall have leisure. Watch ye, stand in the faith, do manfully, &amp; be strengthened. Let all your things be done in charity. And I beseech you, brethren, you know the house of Stephanas, and of Fortunatus, that they are the first fruits of Achaia, &amp; have ordained themselves to the ministry of the saints: that you also be subject to such, and to every one that helpeth &amp; laboureth with us. And I rejoice in the presence of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because that which you wanted, they have supplied. For they have refreshed both my spirit and yours. Know them therefore that are such. The Churches of Asia salute you. Aquila and Priscilla with their domestical Church salute you much in our Lord. All the brethren salute you. Salute one another in a holy kiss. The salutation with mine own hand^ Paul's. If any man love not our Lord JESUS Christ, be he anathema. Maran atha. The grace of our Lord JESUS Christ be with you. My charity be with you all in Christ JESUS. Amen.</div>
