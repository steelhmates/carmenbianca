			<div class='roleText'>Woe to thee that spoilest, shalt not thyself also be spoiled? And that despisest shall not thyself also be despised? When thou shalt have ended spoiling, thou shalt be spoiled: when being wearied thou shalt cease to contemn, thou shalt be contemned. Lord have mercy upon us: for we have expected thee: be our arm in the morning, and our salvation in the time of our tribulation. At the voice of the Angel the peoples fled, and at thy exaltation the nations are dispersed. And your spoils shall be gathered together as the locust is gathered, as when the ditches shall be full thereof. Our Lord is magnified, because he hath dwelt on high: he hath filled Sion with judgement, &amp; justice. And there shall be saith in thy times: riches of salvation, wisdom &amp; knowledge: the fear of our Lord, that is his treasure. Behold they that see shall cry without: the angels of peace shall weep bitterly. The ways are dissipated, the passenger by the path hath ceased, the covenant is made frustrate, he hath rejected the cities, he hath not esteemed the men. The land hath mourned, &amp; languished: Libanus is confounded, &amp; become foul, and Saron is made as a desert: and Basan is shaken, &amp; Carmel. Now will I rise up, saith our Lord: now will I be exalted, now will I be lifted up. You shall conceive heat, you shall bring forth stubble: your spirit as fire shall devour you. And the peoples shall be as ashes of a great fire, thorns gathered together shall be burned with fire. Hear ye that are far off, what things I have done, and ye that are near, know my strength. The sinners are terrified in Sion, trembling hath possessed the hypocrites. Which of you can dwell with devouring fire? Which of you shall dwell with everlasting heats? He that walketh in justices, and speaketh truth, that casteth away avarice of oppression, and shaketh his hands from all gift, that stoppeth his ears lest he hear blood, and shutteth his eyes that he may see no evil. This man shall dwell on high, the munitions of rocks shall be his highness: bread is given to him, his waters are faithful. His eyes shall see the king in his beauty, they shall see the land far off. Thy heart shall meditate fear: where is the learned? Where is he that pondereth the words of the law? Where the teacher of little ones? The unwise people thou shalt not see, the people of profound speech: so that thou canst not understand the eloquence of his tongue, in whom there is no wisdom. Look upon Sion the city of our solemnity: thine eyes shall see Jerusalem, a rich habitation, a tabernacle that cannot be transferred: neither shall the nails thereof be taken away for ever, and all the cords thereof shall not be broken: because only there our Lord is magnifical: a place of floods, rivers most broad and wide: no ship of rowers shall pass by it, neither shall the great galley pass thereby. For the Lord is our judge, the Lord is our law maker, the Lord is our King: he will save us. Thy cords are loosed, and they shall not prevail: thy mast shall be so, that thou canst not spread the sign. Then shall the spoils of many preys be divided: the lame shall take the spoil. Neither shall the neighbour say: I am feeble. The people that dwelleth therein, iniquity shall be taken away from them.</div>
