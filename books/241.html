And the Getheites answered: Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about, and they carried about the ark of the God of Israel. And they carrying it about, the hand of our Lord was made through every city by an exceeding great slaughter: and it struck the men of every city, from little unto great, and they had emeroids in their secret parts. And the Getheites took counsel, and made themselves stools of skins. They sent therefore the ark of God into Accaron.
