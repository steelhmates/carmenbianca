			<div class='roleText'>THIS lo the second epistle I write to you, my dearest, in which I stir up by admonition your sincere mind: that you may be mindful of those words which I told you before from the holy Prophets, and of your Apostles, of the precepts of our Lord and Saviour. Knowing this first, that in the last days shall come mockers in deceit, walking according to their own concupiscences, saying, Where is his promise or his coming? For since the time that the fathers slept, all things do so persevere from the beginning of creature. For they are willfully ignorant of this, that the Heavens were before, and the earth, out of water, and through water, consisting by the word of God: by the which, that world then, being overflowed with water perished. But the Heavens which now are, and the earth, are by the same word kept in store, reserved to fire unto the day of judgement and of the perdition of the impious men. But this one thing be not ignorant of, my dearest, that one day with our Lord is as a thousand years, &amp; a thousand years as one day. Our Lord slacketh not his promise, as some do esteem it: but he doth patiently for you, not willing that any perish, but that all return to penance. And the day of our Lord shall come as a thief, in the which the Heavens shall pass with great violence, but the elements shall be resolved with heat, and the earth and the works which are in it, shall be burnt. Therefore whereas all these things are to be dissolved, what manner of men ought you to be in holy conversations and godlinesses, expecting and hasting unto the coming of the day of our Lord, by which the Heavens burning shall be resolved, and the elements shall melt with the heat of fire? But we expect new Heavens and a new earth according to his promises, in which justice inhabiteth. For the which cause, my dearest, expecting these things, labour earnestly to be found immaculate and unspotted to him in peace: and the longanimity of our Lord, do ye account salvation, as also our most dear brother Paul according to the wisdom given him hath written to you: as also in all epistles speaking in them of these things; in the which are certain things hard to be understood, which the unlearned and unstable deprave, as also the rest of the Scriptures, to their own perdition. You therefore, brethren, fore-knowing, take heed lest led aside by the error of the unwise you fall away from your own steadfastness. But grow in grace and in knowledge of our Lord and Saviour JESUS Christ. To him be glory both now and unto the day of eternity. Amen.</div>
