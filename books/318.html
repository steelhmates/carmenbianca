Moreover out of Syria there were come forth robbers, and had led away captive out of the Land of Israel a little girl, which waited upon the wife of Naaman. Who said to her mistress: I would my lord had been with the prophet, that is in Samaria: surely he would have cured him from the leprosy, which he hath. Naaman therefore went in to his lord, and told him saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Thus and thus hath the wench of the Land of Israel spoken. And the king of Syria said to him: Go, &amp; I will send letters to the king of Israel. Who when he was set forward, &amp; had taken with him ten talents of silver, &amp; six thousand pieces of gold, &amp; ten change of raiment, he brought the letters to the king of Israel, in these words: When thou shalt receive this letter, know that I have sent to thee Naaman my servant, that thou mayest cure him of his leprosy. And when the king of Israel had read the letters, he rent his garments, &amp; said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Am I God, that I can kill, and give life, because this man hath sent to me, that I should cure a man of his leprosy? Mark, and see that he seeketh occasions against me. Which when Eliseus the man of God had heard, to wit, that the king of Israel had rent his garments, he sent to him, saying: </div>

What^ are not Abana and Pharphar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, that I may be washed in them, and be made clean? Therefore when he had turned himself, &amp; went away with indignation, his servants came unto him, &amp; spake to him. Father, &amp; if the Prophet had said a great thing to thee, certes, thou shouldest have done it: how much more whereas now he said unto thee: Be washed, and thou shalt be clean? He went down, and washed in Jordan seven times according to the word of the man of God, and his flesh was restored, as the flesh of a little child, and he was made clean. And returning to the man of God with all his train, he came, and stood before him, &amp; said: </div>
