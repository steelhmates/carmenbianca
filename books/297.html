			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in the four hundred and four score year of the coming forth of the children of Israel out of the Land of Aegypt, in the fourth year, the month Zio (that is the second month) of the reign of Salomon over Israel, he began to build a house to our Lord. And the house, which king Salomon built to our Lord, had three score cubits in length, &amp; twenty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height. And there was a porch before the temple of twenty cubits of length, according to the measure of the breadth of the temple: and it had ten cubits of breadth before the face of the temple. And he made in the temple oblique windows. And he built upon the wall of the temple lofts round about, in the walls of the house round about the temple and the oracle, and he made sides round about. The loft that was underneath, had five cubits of breadth, &amp; the middle loft was of six cubits in breadth, and the third loft had seven cubits of breadth. And he put beams in the house round about on the outside, that they might not cleave to the walls of the temple. And the house when it was built, was built of stones hewed and perfected: and hammer, and hatchet, and all the tool of iron were not heard in the house when it was built. The door of the middle side was in the wall of the house on the right hand: and by winding stairs they went up into the middle room, and from the middle into the third. And he built the house, and finished it: he covered also the house with ceilings of cedar trees. And he built a loft over all the house five cubits of height, and he covered the house with cedar timber. And the word of our Lord came to Salomon, saying: This house, which thou buildest, if thou wilt walk in my precepts, and to my judgments, and keep all my commandments, going in them, I will establish my word to thee, which I spake to David thy father. And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and will not forsake my people Israel. Salomon therefore built the house, and finished it. And he built the walls of the house on the inside, with cedar lofts, from the pavement of the house to the top of the walls, and to the roofs, he covered it with cedar trees on the inside: and he covered the floor of the house with boards of fir. And he built lofts of cedar timber of twenty cubits at the hinder part of the temple, from the pavement to the higher parts: and he made the inner house of the oracle to be Sanctum Sanctorum. Moreover the temple itself was forty cubits before the doors of the oracle. And all the house was covered within with cedar, having roundels, and the joints thereof cunningly wrought, and the engravings standing out: all things were covered with boards: neither could there a stone appear in the wall at all. And he made the oracle in the midst of the house, in the inner part, that he might put the ark of covenant of our Lord there. Moreover the oracle had twenty cubits in length, and twenty cubits of breadth, and twenty cubits in height. And he covered and sealed it with most pure gold. And the altar also he decked with cedar. The house also before the oracle he covered with most pure gold, and fastened on plates with nails of gold. And there was nothing in the temple that was not covered with gold: yea and all the altar of the oracle he covered with gold. And he made in the oracle two Cherubs of olive trees, of ten cubits in height. One wing of a cherub of five cubits, and the other wing of a cherub five cubits: that is, having ten cubits, from the end of one wing unto the end of the other wing. Of ten cubits also was the second cherub: in like measure, and the work was one in both cherubs, that is to say, one cherub had the height of ten cubits, and in like manner the second cherub. And he put the cherubs in the midst of the inner temple: and the cherubs extended their wings, and the one wing touched the wall, and the wing of the second cherub touched the other wall: and the other wings in the middle part of the temple touched each other. He covered also the cherubs with gold. And all the walls of the temple round about he graved with diverse engravings and carving: &amp; he made in them cherubs, and palm trees, and diverse pictures, as it were standing out of the wall, and coming forth. Yea the pavement also of the house he covered with gold within and without. And in the entrance of the oracle he made little doors of the timber of olivetrees, and five corner posts. And two doors of olivetimber: and he graved in them pictures of Cherubs, and figures of Palm trees, and graven works standing out very much; and he covered them with gold: and he covered as well the Cherubs and the palmtrees, and the other things with gold. And he made in the entrance of the temple posts of olivetimber four square: and two doors of fir trees, one against another: and either door was double, &amp; so opened with folding leaves. And he graved Cherubs, and palmtrees, and engravings appearing very much: and he covered all with golden plates in square work by rule. And he built the inner court with three rows of stones polished, &amp; one row of cedar timber. In the fourth year was the house of our Lord founded in the month of Zio: and in the eleventh year in the month Bul (that is the eighth month) the house was perfected in all the works thereof, and in all the implements thereof: and he was building it seven years.</div>
