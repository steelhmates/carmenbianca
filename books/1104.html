			<div class='roleText'>AND again he entered into Capharnaum after some days, and it was heard that he was in the house, and many came together, so that there was no place; no not at the door; &amp; he spake to them the Word. And they came to him bringing one sick of the palsy, who was carried of four. And when they could not offer him unto him for the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was: and opening it they did let down the couch wherein the sick of the palsy lay. And when JESUS had seen their faith, he saith to the sick of the palsy: Son, thy sins are forgiven thee. And there were certain of the Scribes sitting there and thinking in their hearts: Why doth he speak so? He blasphemeth. Who can forgive sins but only God? Which by and by JESUS knowing in his Spirit, that they so thought within themselves, saith to them: Why think you these things in your hearts? Whether is easier, to say to the sick of the palsy: Thy sins are forgiven thee; or to say: Arise, take up thy couch, and walk? But that you may know that the Son of man hath power in earth to forgive sins (he saith to the sick of the palsy) I say to thee, arise, take up thy couch, and go into thy house. And forthwith he arose; and taking up his couch, went his way in the sight of all, so that all marveled, and glorified God, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>That we never saw the like. And he went forth again to the sea; and all the multitude came to him, and he taught them. And when he passed by, he saw Levi of Alphaeus sitting at the custom place; and he saith to him: Follow me. And rising up he followed him. And it came to pass, as he sat at meat in his house, many Publicans and sinners did sit down together with JESUS and his Disciples. For they were many, who also followed him. And the Scribes &amp; the Pharisees seeing that he did eat with Publicans and sinners, said to his Disciples: Why doth your Master eat &amp; drink with Publicans and sinners? JESUS hearing this, saith to them: The whole have not need of a Physician, but they that are ill at ease. For I came not to call the just, but sinners. And the Disciples of John and the Pharisees did use to fast: and they come, and say to him: Why do the Disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast; but thy Disciples do not fast? And JESUS said to them: Why, can the children of the marriage fast, as long as the bridegroom is with them? So long time as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them; and then they shall fast in those days. Nobody soweth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment: otherwise he taketh away the new piecing from the old, and there is made a greater rent. And nobody putteth new wine into old bottles: otherwise the wine bursteth the bottles, and the wine will he shed, and the bottles will be lost. But new wine must be put into new bottles. And it came to pass again when he walked through the corn on the Sabboths, and his Disciples began to go forward and to pluck the ears. And the Pharisees said to him: Behold, why do they on the Sabboths that which is not lawful? And he said to them: Did you never read what David did, when he was in necessity, and himself was an hungered and they that were with him? how he entered into the house of God under Abiathar the high Priest, and did eat the loaves of Proposition, which it was not lawful to eat but for the Priests, and did give unto them which were with him? And he said to them: The Sabboth was made for man, and not man for the Sabboth. Therefore the Son of man is Lord of the Sabboth also.</div>
