			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, to the children of Core, a Psalm. O Lord thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob. Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people: thou hast covered all their sins. Thou hast mitigated all thy wrath: thou hast turned away from the wrath of thine indignation. Convert us, o God our Saviour: and avert thy wrath from us. Wilt thou be wrath with us for ever? Or wilt thou extend thy wrath from generation unto generation? O God thou being turned shalt quicken us: and thy people shall rejoice in thee. Shew us, o Lord, thy mercy and give us thy salvation. I will hear what our Lord God will speak in me: because he will speak peace upon his people. And upon his saints: and upon them, that are converted to the heart. But yet his salvation is nigh to them that fear him: that glory may inhabit in our land. Mercy and truth have met each other: justice and peace have kissed. Truth is risen out of the earth: and justice hath looked down from heaven. For our Lord certes will give benignity: and our land shall give her fruit. Justice shall walk before him: and shall set his steps in the way.</div>
