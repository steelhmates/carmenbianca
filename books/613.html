			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm in confession. Make ye jubilation to God all the earth: serve ye our Lord in gladness. Enter ye in before his sight, in exultation. Know ye that our Lord he is God: he made us, &amp; not we ourselves. His people, and the sheep of his pasture: enter ye into his gates in confession, his courts in hymns, confess ye to him. Praise ye his name: because our Lord is sweet, his mercy for ever, and his truth even unto generation and generation.</div>
