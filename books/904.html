			<div class='roleText'>How doth the city full of people, sit solitary: how is the lady of the Gentiles become as a widow: the princess of Provinces is made tributary? Weeping she hath wept in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: there is none to comfort her of all her dear ones: all her friends have despised her, and are become her enemies. Judas is gone into transmigration because of affliction, and the multitude of bondage: she hath dwelt among the Gentiles, neither hath she found rest: all her persecuters have apprehended her within the straits. The ways of Sion mourn, because there are none that come to the solemnity: all her gates are destroyed: her priests sighing: her virgins loathsome, and herself is oppressed with bitterness. Her adversaries are made in the head, her enemies are enriched: because our Lord hath spoken upon her for the multitude of her iniquities: her little ones are led into captivity, before the face of the afflicter. And from the daughter of Sion all her beauty is departed: her princes are become as rams not finding pastures: and they are gone without strength before the face of the pursuer. Jerusalem hath remembered the days of her affliction, and prevarication of all her things worthy to be desired, which she had from the days of old, when her people fell in the enemy's hand, and there was no helper: the enemies have seen her, and have scorned her sabbaths. Jerusalem hath sinned a sin, therefore is she made unstable: all that did glorify her, have despised her, because they have seen her ignominy: but she sighing is turned backward. Her filthiness is on her feet, neither hath she remembered her end: she is pulled down exceedingly, not having a comforter: see o Lord mine affliction, because the enemy is exalted. The enemy hath thrust his hand to all her things worthy to be desired: because she hath seen the Gentiles enter into her sanctuary, of whom thou gavest commandment that they should not enter into thy church. All her people sighing, and seeking bread: they have given all precious things for meat to refresh the soul, see o Lord and consider, because I am become vile. O all ye that pass by the way, attend, and see if there be sorrow like to my sorrow: because he hath made vintage of me, as our Lord hath spoken in the day of the wrath of his fury. From on high he hath cast a fire in my bones, and hath taught me: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me backward: he hath made me desolate, all the day consumed with sorrow. The yoke of mine iniquities hath watched: they are folded together in his hand, and put upon my neck: my strength is weakened: our Lord hath given me into the hand, from which I cannot rise. Our Lord hath taken away all my magnifical ones out of the midst of me: he hath called a time against me, to destroy mine elect: our Lord hath trodden the winepress to the virgin the daughter of Juda. Therefore am I weeping, and mine eye shedding tears: because a comforter is made far from me, converting my soul: my children are become desolate because the enemy hath prevailed. Sion hath spread forth her hands, there is none to comfort her: our Lord hath commanded against Jacob, round about him are his enemies: Jerusalem is become as a woman polluted with menstruous flowers among them. Our Lord is just, because I have provoked his mouth to wrath: hear I beseech all ye peoples, and see my sorrow: my virgins, and my young men are gone into captivity. I have called my friends, they have deceived me: my priests and my ancients are consumed in the city: because they have sought meat for themselves, to refresh their soul. See o Lord that I am in tribulation, my belly is troubled: my heart is overturned in myself, because I am full of bitterness: the sword killeth abroad, and at home it is like death. They have heard that I do sigh, and there is none to comfort me: all mine enemies have heard mine evil, they have rejoiced, because thou hast done it: thou hast brought a day of consolation, and they shall be made like to me. Let all their evil enter in before thee: and vintage them, as thou hast vintaged me for all mine iniquities: for my sighings are many, and my heart is sorrowful.</div>
