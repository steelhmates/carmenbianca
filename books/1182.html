			<div class='roleText'>AND it came to pass when Apollo was at Corinth, that Paul having gone through the higher parts came to Ephesus, and found certain Disciples: and he said to them: Have you received the Holy Ghost, believing? But they said to him: Nay, neither have we heard whether there be a Holy Ghost. But he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>John baptized the people with the Baptism of penance, saying, That they should believe in him that was to come after him, that is to say, in JESUS. Hearing these things, they were baptized in the name of our Lord JESUS. And when Paul had imposed hands on them, the Holy Ghost came upon them, &amp; they spake with tongues, and prophesied. And all the men were about twelve. And entering into the Synagogue, he spake confidently for three months, disputing &amp; exhorting of the Kingdom of God. But when certain were indurate, and believed not, ill-speaking the way of our Lord before the multitude, departing from them, he separated the Disciples, daily disputing in the school of one Tyrannus. And this was done for the space of two years, so that all which dwelt in Asia, heard the word of our Lord, Jews and Gentiles. And God wrought by the hand of Paul miracles not common: so that there were also brought from his body napkins or handkerchiefs upon the sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the wicked spirits went out. And certain also of the Judaical exorcists that went about, assayed to invocate upon them that had evil spirits, the name of our Lord JESUS, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I adjure you by JESUS whom Paul preacheth. And there were certain sons of Sceva a Jew, chief Priest, seven, that did this. But the wicked spirit answering, said to them: JESUS I know, and Paul I know: but you, what are ye? And the man in whom the wicked spirit was, leaping upon them, and mastering both, prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. And this was made notorious to all the Jews and the Gentiles that dwelt at Ephesus: and fear fell upon all them, and the name of our Lord JESUS was magnified. And many of them that believed, came confessing &amp; declaring their deeds. And many of them that had followed curious things, brought together their books, and burnt them before all: and counting the prices of them, they found the money to be fifty thousand pence. So mightily increased the word of God and was confirmed. And when these things were ended, Paul purposed in the Spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>After I shall have been there, I must see Rome also. And sending into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothee and Erastus, himself remained for a time in Asia. And at that time there was made no little trouble about the way of our Lord. For one named Demetrius, a silver-smith, that made silver temples of Diana, procured to the artificers no small gain: whom calling together and them that were the same kind of workmen, he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Sirs, you know that our gain is of this occupation; and you see, and hear that this same Paul by persuasion hath averted a great multitude not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, saying: </div>

And not only unto us is this part in danger to be reproved, but also the temple of great Diana shall be reputed for nothing, yea &amp; her majesty shall begin to be destroyed, whom all Asia &amp; the world worshippeth. Hearing these things they were replenished with anger, and cried out saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Great is Diana of the Ephesians. And the whole city was filled with confusion, and they ran violently with one accord into the theater, catching Gaius &amp; Aristarchus^ Macedonians, Paul's companions. And when Paul would have entered in to the people, the Disciples did not permit him. And certain also of the Princes of Asia that were his friends, sent unto him, desiring that he would not adventure himself into the theater: and others cried another thing. For the assembly was confuse, &amp; the more part knew not for what cause they were assembled. And of the multitude they drew forth Alexander, the Jews thrusting him forward. But Alexander with his hand desiring silence, would have given the people satisfaction. Whom as soon as they perceived to be a Jew, there was made one voice of all, almost for the space of two hours crying out: Great is Diana of the Ephesians. And when the Scribe had appeased the multitudes, he saith: Ye men of Ephesus, for what man is there that knoweth not the city of the Ephesians to be a worshipper of great Diana, and Jupiter's child? Forasmuch therefore as these things cannot be gainsaid, you must be quieted, and do nothing rashly. For you have brought these men, being neither sacrilegious, nor blaspheming your goddess. But if Demetrius &amp; the artificers that are with him, have matter to say against any man, there are Courts kept in the common place, &amp; there are Proconsuls; let them accuse one another. And if you ask any other matter, it may be resolved in a lawful assembly. For we are in danger also to be accused for this day's sedition: whereas there is no man guilty by whom we may give an account of this concourse. And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</div>
