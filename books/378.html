			<div class='roleText'>And Roboam came into Jerusalem, and called together all the house of Juda and Benjamin, an hundred fourscore thousand chosen men and warriors, to fight against Israel, and to convert his Kingdom unto him. And the word of our Lord came to Semeias the man of God, saying: Speak to Roboam the son of Salomon the king of Juda, and to all Israel, that is in Juda and Benjamin: Thus saith our Lord: You shall not go up, neither shall you fight against your brethren: let every man return into his house, because this thing is done by my will. Who when they had heard the word of our Lord, returned, neither went they forward against Jeroboam. And Roboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built walled cities in Juda. And he built Bethlehem, and Etam, and Thecue, Bethsur also, and Socho, and Odollam, moreover also Geth, and Maresa, and Ziph, yea and Aduram, and Lachis, and Azeca, Saraa also, and Aialon, and Hebron, which were in Juda and Benjamin, most fenced cities. And when he had inclosed them with walls, he put in them Princes, and store houses of victuals, that is, of oil and wine. Yea and in every city he made armories of shields and spears, and he strengthened them with great diligence, and reigned over Juda and Benjamin. And the Priests and Levites, that were in all Israel, came to him out of all their seats, leaving their suburbs, and their possessions, and passing to Juda, and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam had cast them off, and their posterity: that they should not execute the priesthood of our Lord. Who made unto himself Priests of the excelses, and of devils, and of the calves which he had made. Yea and of all the tribes of Israel, whosoever had given their heart to seek our Lord the God of Israel, came into Jerusalem to immolate their victims before our Lord the God of their fathers. And they strengthened the Kingdom of Juda, and established Roboam the son of Salomon for three years: for they walked in the ways of David and Salomon, only three years. And Roboam took to wife Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth the son of David: Abihail also the daughter of Eliab the son of Isai, who bare him sons, Jehus, &amp; Somorias, and Zoom. After this woman also he took Maacha the daughter of Absalom, who bare him Abia, and Ethai, and Ziza, &amp; Salomith. And Roboam loved Maacha the daughter of Absalom above all his wives and concubines: for he had married eighteen wives, and threescore concubines: and he begat eight and twenty sons, and threescore daughters. But he appointed for head Abias the son of Maacha duke over all his brethren: for he meant to make him king, because he was wiser, and mightier above all his sons, and in all the coasts of Juda, and of Benjamin, and in all the walled cities: and he gave them much meat, and he desired many wives.</div>
