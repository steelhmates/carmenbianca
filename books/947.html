			<div class='roleText'>And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and thou shalt say to them: The land when I shall bring the sword in upon it, and the people of the land take a man, one of their meanest, and make him a watchman over them: and he shall see the sword coming upon the land, and sound with the trumpet, and tell the people: and he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, whosoever he be, and doth not look to himself, and the sword come, and take him: his blood shall be upon his head. He heard the sound of the trumpet, and did not look to himself, his blood shall be on himself: but if he shall look to himself, he shall save his life. And if the watchman see the sword coming, &amp; sound not with the trumpet: and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come, and take a soul from among them: he certes is caught in his iniquity, but his blood I will require of the hand of the watchman. And thou son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: hearing therefore the word from my mouth, thou shalt tell them from me. If when I say to the impious: O thou impious, dying thou shalt die: thou speak not that the impious may keep himself from his way: the impious himself shall die in his iniquity, but his blood I will require at thy hand. But if thou telling the impious, that he convert from his ways, he convert not from his way: he shall die in his iniquity: but thou hast delivered thy soul. Thou therefore o son of man say to the house of Israel: Thus you have spoken, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Our iniquities, &amp; our sins are upon us, and in them we fade away: how then can we live? Say to them: Live I, saith our Lord God: I will not the death of the impious, but that the impious convert from his way, and live. Convert, convert ye from your most evil ways: and why will you die, o house of Israel? Thou therefore son of man say to the children of thy people: The justice of the just shall not deliver him, in what day soever he shall sin: and the impiety of the impious shall not hurt him, in what day soever he shall convert from his impiety: and the just cannot live in his justice, in what day soever he shall sin. Yea if I shall say to the just that living he shall live, &amp; he trusting in his justice do iniquity: all his justices shall be forgotten, &amp; in his iniquity, which he hath wrought, in the same shall he die. And if I shall say to the impious: Dying thou shalt die: &amp; he do penance from his sin &amp; do judgement &amp; justice, &amp; the same impious restore pledge, and render robbery, walk in the commandments of life, and do not any unjust thing: living he shall live, &amp; shall not die. All his sins, which he hath sinned, shall not be imputed to him: he hath done judgement &amp; justice, living he shall live. And the children of thy people, have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The way of our Lord is not of equal weight, &amp; their own way is unjust. For when the just shall depart from his justice, &amp; do iniquities, he shall die in them. And when the impious shall depart from his impiety, &amp; shall do judgements, &amp; justice: he shall live in them. And you say: The way of our Lord is not right, every one according to his ways will I judge of you, o house of Israel. And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the tenth month, in the fifth of the month of our transmigration, there came to me one that was fled from Jerusalem, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The city is made waste. And the hand of our Lord had been made to me in the evening, before he came that was fled: &amp; he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning, &amp; my mouth being opened I was silent no more. And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, They that dwell in these ruinous places, upon the ground of Israel, speaking do say: Abraham was one, and by inheritance he possessed the land: but we be many, the land is given us in possession. Therefore thou shalt say to them: Thus saith our Lord God: Ye that eat in blood &amp; lift up your eyes to your uncleanness, &amp; shed blood: what^ shall you possess the land by inheritance? You stood on your swords, you have done abominations, &amp; every one hath polluted his neighbour's wife: &amp; you will possess the land by inheritance? Thus thou shalt say to them: Thus saith our Lord God: Live I, that they which dwell in the ruinous places, shall fall by the sword: &amp; he that is in the field, shall be delivered to beasts to be devoured: and they that are in holds, and caves, shall die of the pestilence. And I will give the land into a wilderness, &amp; into a desert, and the proud strength thereof shall fail, and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, because there is none to pass by them. And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall give their land desolate and desert for all their abominations, which they have wrought. And thou son of man: the children of thy people, which speak of thee by the walls, and in the doors of houses, and one saith to another, a man to his neighbour, speaking: Come, &amp; let us hear what is the word that proceedeth from our Lord. And they come to thee, as if a people should go in, and my people sit before thee: and they hear thy words, and do them not: because they turn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart followeth their avarice. And thou art unto them as a musical song which is sung with sweet and pleasant sound: and they hear thy words, and do them not. And when it shall come to pass which was told before (for behold it cometh) then shall they know that there was a prophet among them.</div>
