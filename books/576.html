			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of David when he was in the desert of Juda. O God my God to thee I watch, from the morning light. My soul hath thirsted to thee, my flesh to thee very many ways. In a desert land, and inaccessible, and without water, so in the holy have I appeared to thee, that I might see thy strength, and thy glory. Because thy mercy is better than lives, my lips shall praise thee. So will I bless thee in my life: and in thy name I will lift up my hands. As with marrow and fatness let my soul be filled: and my mouth shall praise with lips of exultation. If I have been mindful of thee upon my bed, in the morning I will meditate on thee: because thou hast been my helper. And in the covert of thy wings I will rejoice, my soul hath cleaved after thee: thy right hand hath received me. But they in vain have sought my soul, they shall enter into the inferior parts of the earth. They shall be delivered into the hands of the sword, they shall be the portions of foxes. But the king shall rejoice in God, all shall be praised that swear by him: because the mouth is stopped of those that speak wicked things.</div>
