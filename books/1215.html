			<div class='roleText'>AND concerning those things that are sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffeth up; but charity edifieth. And if any man think that he knoweth something, he hath not yet known, as he ought to know. But if any man love God, the same is known of him. But as for the meats that are immolated to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no God, but one. For although there be that are called gods, either in Heaven, or in earth (for there are many gods, and many lords) yet to us there is one God, the Father, of whom all things, and we unto him: and one Lord, JESUS CHRIST, by whom all things, and we by him. But there is not knowledge in all. For some until this present with a conscience of the idol, eat as a thing sacrificed to idols: and their conscience being weak, is polluted. But meat doth not commend us to God. For neither if we eat, shall we abound: nor if we eat not, shall we lack. But take heed lest perhaps this your liberty become an offence to the weak. For if a man see him that hath knowledge, sit at table in the idol's temple; shall not his conscience, being weak, be edified, to eat things sacrificed to idols? And through thy knowledge shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ hath died? But sinning thus against the brethren, and striking their weak conscience; you sin against Christ. Wherefore if meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh, lest I scandalize my brother.</div>
