			<div class='roleText'>Which things being heard, all the kings beyond Jordan, that dwelt in the mountains and champion countries, in the places by the sea side and the shore of the great sea, they also that dwelt beside Libanus, the Hetheite and Amorrhite, the Chananite, the Pherezite, and the Heveite, and the Jebusite, were gathered to fight against Josue and Israel with one mind and one sentence. But they that dwelt in Gabaon, hearing all things that Josue had done to Jericho and Hai: subtly devising took provision for themselves, laying old sacks upon their asses, &amp; bottles of wine rent and sowed again, and shoes very old which for a shew of oldness were clouted with specks, putting on them old garments: the loaves also, which they carried for provision by the way, were hard, and broken into pieces: and they went on to Josue, who then abode in the camp at Galgal, and said to him, and withal to all Israel: We are come from a far country, desirous to make peace with you. And the children of Israel answered them, and said: Lest perhaps you dwell in the Land which is due to us by lot, and we cannot enter a league with you. But they said to Josue: We are thy servants.

			<div class='roleText'>Who are you? &amp; whence came you? They answered: From a very far country are thy servants come, in the name of the Lord thy God. For we have heard the same of his might, all things that he did in Aegypt, and to the two kings of the Amorrheites that were beyond Jordan, Sehon the king of Hesebon, and Og the king of Basan, that were in Astaroth, and our ancients, and all the inhabitants of our Land said to us: Take in your hands victuals for a very long way, and go meet them, and say: We are your servants, enter a league with us. Behold, these loaves we took hot, when we departed from our houses to come to you, now they are become dry, and broken for over-much oldness. The bottles of wine was filled being new, now they are burst and dissolved. The garments and shoes that we have upon us, &amp; which we have on our feet, for the length of the long way are worn, and almost consumed. They took therefore of their victuals, &amp; asked not the mouth of our Lord. And Josue made peace with them, and entering a league promised that they should not be slain: the princes also of the multitude sware to them. But three days after that the league was made, they heard that they dwelt nigh, and they should be among them. And the children of Israel removed the camp, and came into their cities the third day, whose names are these, Gabaon, and Chaphira, and Beroth, and Chariathiarim. And they struck them not, because the princes of the multitude had sworn in the name of our Lord the God of Israel. Therefore all the common people murmured against the princes. Who answered them: We have sworn to them in the name of our Lord the God of Israel, and therefore we may not touch them. But this we will do to them: Let them be reserved indeed alive, lest the wrath of God be stirred against us, if we shall be forsworn: but so let them live, that for the uses of the whole multitude they hew wood, and carry in water. Who speaking these things, Josue called the Gabaonites, and said to them: Why would you deceive us by fraud to say: We dwell very far off from you, whereas you are in the midst of us? Therefore you shall be under a curse, and there shall not fail of your stock a hewer of wood, and a carrier of water into the house of my God. Who answered: It was told us thy servants, that the Lord thy God had promised Moyses his servant, that he would deliver you all the Land and would destroy all the inhabitants thereof. Therefore we feared exceedingly and provided for our lives, compelled by your terror, and we took this counsel. And now we are in thy hand: that which seemeth unto thee good and right, do to us. Josue therefore did as he had said, and delivered them from the hand of the children of Israel, that they should not be slain. And he decreed in that day, that they should be in the ministry of all the people, and of the altar of our Lord, hewing wood, and carrying water, until this present time, in the place which our Lord had chosen.</div>
