			<div class='roleText'>Love therefore the Lord thy God, and observe his precepts &amp; ceremonies, his judgments and commandments at all time. Know this day the things that your children know not, who saw not the discipline of the Lord your God, his great doings and strong hand and stretched out arm, the signs and works which he did in the midst of Aegypt to Pharao the king, and to all his land, and to all the host of the Aegyptians, and to their hosts and chariots: how the waters of the red sea covered them, when they pursued you, and how our Lord destroyed them until this present day: and to you what things he hath done in the wilderness, till you came to this place: and to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, which was the son of Ruben: whom the earth opening her mouth swallowed up with their houses and tabernacles, and all their substance, which they had in the midst of Israel. Your eyes have seen all the great works of our Lord, that he hath done, that you may keep all his commandments, which I command you this day, and may enter in, and possess the Land, to the which you enter, and may live in it a great time: which our Lord by oath promised to your fathers, and to their seed, flowing with milk and honey. For the Land, which thou goest to possess, is not as the Land of Aegypt, which thou camest out of, where when the seed is sown, waters are brought in to water it after the manner of gardens: but it is hilly and champion, expecting rain from heaven, which the Lord thy God doth always visit, and his eyes are on it from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof. If then you obey my commandments, which I command you this day, that you love the Lord your God, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul, he will give rain to your Land: the timely and the lateward, that you may gather your corn, and wine, and oil, and hay out of the fields to feed your cattle, and that yourselves may eat and be filled. Beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived, and you depart from our Lord, and serve strange gods, &amp; adore them: and our Lord being wrath shut up heaven, and the rain come not down, nor the earth give her spring, and you perish quickly from the excellent Land, which our Lord will give you. Put these my words in your hearts and minds, and hang them for a sign on your hands, and place them between your eyes. Teach your children that they meditate them, when thou sittest in thy house, and walkest on the way, and liest down and risest up. Thou shalt write them upon the posts and gates of thy house: that thy days may be multiplied, and the days of thy children in the Land, which our Lord sware to thy fathers, that he would give it them as long as the heaven hangeth over the earth. For if you keep the commandments which I command you, and do them, that you love the Lord your God, &amp; walk in all his ways, cleaving to him, our Lord will destroy all these nations before your face, and you shall possess them, which are greater and stronger than you. Every place that your foot shall tread, shall be yours. From the desert, and from Libanus, from the great river Euphrates unto the west sea shall be your borders. None shall stand against you: your terror &amp; fear shall the Lord your God give upon all the land that you shall tread, as he hath spoken to you. Behold I set forth in your sight this day benediction and malediction: benediction, if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, which I command you this day: malediction, if you obey not the commandments of the Lord your God, but revolt from the way, which now I do shew you, and walk after strange gods, which you know not. And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the Land, to the which thou goest to inhabit, thou shalt put the benediction upon mount Garizim, the malediction upon mount Hebal: which are beyond Jordan behind the way that bendeth to the going down of the sun in the Land of the Chananite, which dwelleth in the champion country against Galgala, which is beside the valley that reacheth and entereth far. For you shall pass over Jordan, to possess the Land which the Lord your God will give you, that you may have and possess it. See therefore that you fulfill the ceremonies and judgments, which I shall set this day in your sight.</div>
