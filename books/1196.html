			<div class='roleText'>BEING justified therefore by faith, let us have peace toward God by our Lord JESUS CHRIST; by whom also we have access through faith into this grace wherein we stand, and glory, in the hope of the glory of the sons of God. And not only this; but also we glory in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience: and patience, probation; and probation, hope; and hope confoundeth not: because the charity of God is poured forth in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost which is given us. For why did Christ, when we as yet were weak, according to the time die for the impious? For, scarce for a just man doth any die: for perhaps for a good man durst some man die. But God commendeth his charity in us: because, when as yet we were sinners, Christ died for us. Much more therefore now being justified in his blood, shall we be saved from wrath by him. For if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, shall we be saved in the life of him. And not only this; but also we glory in God through our Lord JESUS Christ, by whom now we have received reconciliation. Therefore, as by one man sin entered into this world, and by sin death; and so unto all men death did pass, in which all sinned. For even unto the Law sin was in the world: but sin was not imputed, when the Law was not. But death reigned from Adam unto Moyses, even on them also that sinned not after the similitude of the prevarication of Adam, who is a figure of him to come. But not as the offence, so also the gift. For if by the offence of one, many died; much more the grace of God and the gift, in the grace of one man JESUS Christ, hath abounded upon many. And not as by one sin, so also the gift. For judgement indeed is of one, to condemnation: but grace is of many offences, to justification. For if in the offence of one, death reigned by one; much more they that receive the aboundance of grace and of donation &amp; of justice, shall reign in life by one, JESUS Christ. Therefore as by the offence of one, unto all men to condemnation; so also by the justice of one, unto all men to justification of life. For as by the disobedience of one man, many were made sinners; so also by the obedience of one, many shall be made just. But the Law entered in, that sin might abound. And where sin abounded, grace did more abound. That as sin reigned to death; so also grace may reign by justice to life everlasting, through JESUS Christ our Lord.</div>
