			<div class='roleText'>Be a firmament made amidst the waters: and let it divide between waters and waters. And God made a firmament, and divided the waters that were under the firmament, from those that were above the firmament. And it was so done. And God called the firmament, Heaven: and there was evening &amp; morning^ that made the second day. God also said: </div>
