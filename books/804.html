			<div class='roleText'>The burden of Aegypt. Behold our Lord will ascend upon a swift cloud, and will enter into Aegypt, and the idols of Aegypt shall be moved at his presence, &amp; the heart of Aegypt shall melt in the midst thereof. And I will make the Aegyptians to run together against the Aegyptians: and a man shall fight against his brother, &amp; every man against his friend, city against city, kingdom against kingdom. And the spirit of Aegypt shall be broken in the bowels thereof, &amp; I will overthrow their counsel headlong: and they shall ask their idols, &amp; their diviners, and Pythons, and Soothsayers. And I will deliver Aegypt into the hand of cruel masters, and a strong king shall rule over them, saith our Lord the God of hosts. And the water of the sea shall be dried up, &amp; the river shall be made desolate, and dry. And the rivers shall fail: the rivers of the rampiers shall be diminished, &amp; dried up. The reed and bulrush shall wither: the channel of the river shall be spoiled of his fountain, &amp; all sown corn field that is watered shall be dried up, it shall wither, and shall not be. And the fishers shall lament, &amp; all that cast angle into the river shall mourn, and they that spread net upon the face of the water shall pine away. They shall be confounded that wrought twisting flax, combing and weaving fine things. And the watered places thereof shall be dry, all they that made pools to take fishes. The Princes of Tanis are fools, the wise counsellers of Pharao have given unwise counsel: how say ye unto Pharao: I am the son of the wise, the son of the ancient kings? Where are now thy wise men? Let them tell thee, &amp; shew what the Lord of hosts hath thought concerning Aegypt. The Princes of Tanis are become fools, the Princes of Memphis are withered away, they have deceived Aegypt, the corner of the peoples thereof. Our Lord hath mingled in the midst thereof the spirit of gladness: and they have made Aegypt to err in every work thereof, as he erreth that is drunk and vomiteth. And Aegypt shall have no work, to make the head and the tail, the perverter and restrainer. In that day Aegypt shall be as women, &amp; they shall be astonished, &amp; shall be afraid at the face of the moving of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shall move over it. And the land of Juda shall be a fear to Aegypt: every one that shall remember it, shall quake at the face of the counsel of the Lord of hosts, which he hath thought concerning it. In that day there shall be five cities in the land of Aegypt, speaking the tongue of Chanaan, and swearing by the Lord of hosts: one shall be called the city of the sun. In that day there shall be an altar of our Lord in the midst of the land of Aegypt, and a title of our Lord by the border thereof: it shall be for a sign, and for a testimony to the Lord of hosts in the land of Aegypt. For they shall cry to our Lord at the presence of the afflicter, and he shall send them a saviour and defender to deliver them. And our Lord shall be known of Aegypt, &amp; the Aegyptians shall know our Lord in that day, and shall worship him in hosts and in gifts: and they shall vow vows to our Lord, and pay them. And our Lord shall smite Aegypt with a stroke, and heal it, and they shall return to our Lord, and he shall be pacified towards them, and heal them. In that day there shall be a way from Aegypt to the Assyrians, and the Assyrian shall enter into Aegypt, and the Aegyptians to the Assyrians, &amp; the Aegyptians shall serve Assur. In that day shall Israel be a third to the Aegyptian and the Assyrian: a blessing in the midst of the earth, which the Lord of hosts hath blessed, saying: </div>
