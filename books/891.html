			<div class='roleText'>The word that was made to Jeremy from our Lord, after that he was dismist of Nabuzardan master of the war from Rama, when he took him bound with chains in the midst of all, that went in transmigration of Jerusalem and Juda, and were led into Babylon. The Prince therefore of the war taking Jeremy, said to him: The Lord thy God hath spoken this evil upon this place, and hath brought it: and the Lord hath done as he hath spoken because you have sinned to the Lord, and have not heard his voice, and this word is fallen to you. Now then behold I have loosed thee this day from the chains, that are on thy hands: if it please thee to come with me into Babylon, come: and I will set mine eyes upon thee: but if it please thee not to come with me into Babylon, tarry: behold all the land is in thy sight, that which thou shalt choose, and whither it shall please thee to go, thither go. And come not with me: but dwell with Godolias the son of Ahicam, the son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon hath appointed chief over the cities of Juda: dwell therefore with him in the cities of Juda: dwell therefore with him in the midst of the people: or whithersoever it shall please thee to go, go. The master of the war gave him victuals also, and gifts, and dismissed him. And Jeremy came to Godolias the son of Ahicam into Masphath: and dwelt with him in the midst of the people, that was left in the land. And when all the Princes of the army, that were dispersed through the countries, they and their companions, had heard, that the king of Babylon had made Godolias the son of Ahicam governor of the country, &amp; that he had commanded unto him men, &amp; women, &amp; children, &amp; those of the poor of the land, that had not been transported into Babylon. Then came to Godolias into Masphath both Ismahel the son of Nathanias, and Johanan, and Jonathan, the son of Caree, and Sareas the son of Thanehumeth, and the children of Ophi, that were of Netophathie, and Jezonias the son of Maachati, they and their men. And Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan sware to them and to their companions, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Fear not to serve the Chaldees: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. Behold I dwell in Masphath, that I may answer the commandment of the Chaldees, that are sent to us: but you gather ye vintage, and harvest, and oil, and lay it up in your vessels, and abide in your cities which you hold. Yea and all the Jews, that were in Moab, and among the children of Ammon, and in Idumea, and in all the countries, when it was heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Jewry, &amp; that he had made Godolias the son of Ahicam the son of Saphan ruler over them: all the Jews, I say, returned out of all places, to which they had fled, and they came into the land of Juda to Godolias into Masphath: and they gathered wine, and harvest exceeding much. But Johanan the son of Caree, and all the Princes of the host, that had been dispersed in the countries, came to Godolias into Masphath. And they said to him: Know that Baalis the king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ismahel the son of Nathanias to kill thee. And Godolias the son of Ahicam believed them not. But Johanan the son of Caree, spake to Godolias apart in Masphath, saying: </div>
