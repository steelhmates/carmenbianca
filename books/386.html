Every cause, that shall come to you of your brethren, that dwell in their cities, between kindred and kindred, wheresoever there is question of the law, of the commandment, of ceremonies, of justifications: shew it them, that they sin not against our Lord, and lest there come wrath upon you and your brethren: so doing therefore you shall not sin. And Amarias the Priest and your Bishop shall be chief in these things, which pertain to God: moreover Zabadias the son of Ismahel, who is the Prince in the house of Juda, shall be over those works, which pertain to the king's office: and you have masters the Levites before you, take courage, and do diligently, and our Lord will be with the good.</div>
