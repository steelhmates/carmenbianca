			<div class='roleText'>Then Tobias answered his father, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will do all things, father, whatsoever thou hast commanded me. But how I shall require this money, I cannot tell, he knoweth not me, and I know not him: what token shall I give him? Yea neither the way which leadeth thither did I ever know. Then his father answered him, &amp; said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I have the bill of his hand with me, which when thou shalt shew him he will forthwith restore it. But go now, and seek thee out some faithful man, that may go with thee, being sure of his hire: that thou mayst receive it, whilst I yet live. Then Tobias going forth, found a goodly young man, standing girded, and as it were ready to walk. And not knowing that it was an Angel of God, he saluted him, and said: </div>

<li><div class='role'>
			<div class='roleText'>From whence have we thee, good young man? But he answered: Of the children of Israel. And Tobias said to him: Knowest thou the way, that leadeth unto the country of the Medes? To whom he answered: I know it: and all the ways thereof I have often walked, and I have tarried with Gabelus our brother, who abideth in Rages a city of the Medes, which is situate in the Mount Ecbatanis. To whom Tobias said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Stay for me I beseech thee, till I tell these same things to my father. Then Tobias going in told all these things to his father. Where upon his father marveling, requested that he would come in unto him. Going in therefore he saluted him, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Joy be to thee always. And Tobias said: </div>

		</div></li>
<li><div class='role'>
			<div class='roleText'>What manner of joy shall be to me, which sit in darkness, and see not the light of heaven? To whom the young man said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Be of good cheer, it is very near that thou mayst be cured of God. Tobias therefore said to him: Canst thou bring my son to Gabelus into Rages a city of the Medes? And when thou shalt return, I will pay thee thy hire. And the Angel said to him: I will conduct him, and bring him to thee again. To whom Tobias answered: I pray thee tell me, of what house, or what tribe art thou? To whom Raphael the Angel said: </div>

<li><div class='role'>
			<div class='roleText'>Seekest thou the kindred of an hired servant, or an hired servant himself, that may go with thy son? But lest perhaps I make thee careful, I am Azarias the son of Ananias the great. And Tobias answered: Thou art of a great kindred. But I pray thee be not angry that I would know thy kindred. And the Angel said to him: I will lead thy son safe, and bring him to thee again safe. And Tobias answering, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Well may you walk, &amp; God be in your journey, and his Angel accompany you. Then all things being ready that were to be carried in the way, Tobias bid his father and his mother fare well, &amp; they walked both together. And when they were departed, his mother began to weep, and to say: Thou hast taken the staff of our old age, and sent him away from us. I would the money had never been, for the which thou hast sent him. For our poverty sufficed us, that we might account this thing riches, that we saw our son. And Tobias said to her: Weep not, our son shall come thither save, and shall return safe to us, and thine eyes shall see him. For I believe that the good Angel of God doth accompany him, &amp; doth well dispose all things that are done about him, so that he shall return to us with joy. At this voice his mother left weeping, and held her peace.</div>
