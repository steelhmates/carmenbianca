			<div class='roleText'>Thus saith our Lord: What is this bill of the divorce of our mother, wherewith I have dismissed her? Or who is my creditor, to whom I sold you? Lo you are sold for your wicked deeds, I have dismist your mother. Because I came, and there was not a man: I called, and there was none that would hear. Why, is mine hand abridged and made a little one, that I cannot redeem? Or is there no strength in me to deliver? Behold, in my rebuke I will make the sea desert, I will turn the floods into dry land: the fishes shall rot without water, and shall die for thirst. I will clothe the heavens with darkness, and will make sackcloth their covering. The Lord hath given me a learned tongue, that I may know to stay him up that is weary, with a word: he stirreth up in the morning, in the morning he stirreth up mine ear, that I may hear him as a master. The Lord God hath opened mine ear, &amp; I do not gainsay? I am not gone backward. I have given my body to the strikers, &amp; my cheeks to the pluckers: I have not turned away my face from the rebukers &amp; spitters. The Lord God is mine helper, therefore am I not confounded: therefore have I set my face, as a most hard rock, and I know that I shall not be confounded. He is near that justifieth me, who shall gainsay me? Let us stand together. Who is mine adversary? Let him come to me. Behold the Lord God my helper: who is he that shall condemn me? Lo they shall all be destroyed as a garment, the moth shall eat them. Which of you feareth our Lord, heareth the voice of his servant, who hath walked in darkness, and hath no light? Let him hope in the name of our Lord, &amp; lean upon his God. Lo all you do kindle a fire, are compassed with flames, walk in the light of your fire, and in the flames which you have kindled: of my hand is this done to you, you shall sleep in sorrows.</div>
