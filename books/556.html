			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of David. Judge me, o God, &amp; discern my cause from the nation not holy, from the unjust and deceitful man deliver me. Because thou art God my strength: why hast thou repelled me? And why go I sorrowful whilst the enemy afflicteth me. Send forth thy light and thy truth: they have conducted me, and have brought me into thy holy hill, and into thy tabernacles. And I will go in to the altar of God: to God, which maketh my youth joyful. I will confess to thee on the harp o God my God: why art thou sorrowful, o my soul? And why dost thou trouble me? Hope in God, because yet will I confess to him: the salvation of my countenance, and my God.</div>
