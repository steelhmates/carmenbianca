			<div class='roleText'>The children of wisdom are the Church of the just: and their nation, obedience and love. Hear your father's judgement o children, and so do that you may be saved. For God hath honoured the father in the children: and inquiring of the mother's judgement, hath confirmed it upon the children. He that loveth God, praying shall obtain for sins, and shall refrain himself from them, and shall be heard in the prayer of days. And as he that gathereth treasure, so he also that honoureth his mother. He that honoureth his father, shall have joy in children, and in the day of his prayer he shall be heard. He that honoureth his father, shall live the longer life: &amp; he that obeyeth the father, shall refresh the mother. He that feareth our Lord honoureth his parents, and as his lords he will serve them that begat him. In work and word, &amp; all patience honour thy father, that blessing may come upon thee from him, &amp; his blessing may remain in the later end. The father's blessing establisheth the houses of the children: but the mother's curse rooteth up the foundation. Glory not in the contumely of thy father: for his confusion is no glory to thee. For the glory of a man is by the honour of his father, and the father without honour is the dishonour of the son. Son receive the old age of thy father, and make him not sorrowful in his life: and if he fail in understanding, pardon him, and despise him not in thy strength: for the alms to the father shall not be in oblivion. For good shall be restored thee for the sin of thy mother, and in justice it shall be builded to thee, and in the day of tribulation there shall be remembrance of thee: and as ice in the clear weather shall thy sins melt away. Of what an evil fame is he, that forsaketh his father: and he is cursed of God, that doth exasperate his mother. Son do thy works in meekness, and thou shalt be beloved above the glory of men. The greater thou art, humble thyself in all things, and thou shalt find grace before God: because the might of God only is great, and he is honoured of the humble. Seek not things higher than thyself, and search not things stronger than thy hability: but the things that God hath commanded thee, think on them always, and in many of his works be not curious. For it is not necessary for thee, to see with thine eyes those things that are hid. In superfluous things search not many ways, and in many of his works thou shalt not be curious. For very many things are shewed to thee above the understanding of men. Many also have their suspicion supplanted, and have held their senses in vanity. A hard heart shall fare ill in the later end, and he that loveth danger, shall perish in it. A heart that goeth two ways, shall not have success, and the perverse of heart shall be scandalized in them. A wicked heart shall be laden with sorrows, and the sinner will add to commit sin. To the synagogue of the proud there shall be no health: for the shrub of sin shall be rooted up in them, and it shall not be perceived. The heart of the wise is understood in wisdom, and a good ear will hear wisdom with all desire. A wise heart, and that which hath understanding will abstain it-self from sins, and in the works of justice shall have success. Water quencheth burning fire, and alms resisteth sins: and God is the beholder of him that rendereth grace: he remembereth him afterward, and in the time of his fall he shall find a sure stay.</div>
