			<div class='roleText'>Speak to the children of Israel: The soul that sinneth by ignorance, &amp; doth any thing of all the commandments of our Lord, which he commanded not to be done: If the Priest that is anointed sin, making the people to offend, he shall offer for his sin a calf without spot to our Lord, and he shall bring it to the door of testimony before our Lord, and shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall immolate it to our Lord. He shall draw also of the blood of the calf, carrying it into the tabernacle of testimony. And when he hath dipped his finger in the blood he shall sprinkle it seven times before our Lord, against the veil of the Sanctuary. and of the same blood he shall put upon the horns of the altar of incense most acceptable to our Lord, which is in the tabernacle of testimony. And all the rest of the blood he shall pour at the foot of the altar of holocaust in the entry of the tabernacle. And the fat of the calf he shall take away for the sin, as well that which covereth the entrails, as all the parts that are within. The two little kidneys, and the caul that is upon them beside the guts, &amp; the fat of the liver with the two little kidneys, as is taken away from the calf which is an host of pacifics, and he shall burn them upon the altar of holocaust. But the skin and all the flesh with the head and feet and bowels and dung, and the rest of the body he shall carry forth without the camp into a clean place, where the ashes are wont to be poured out: and he shall burn them upon a pile of wood, which shall be burnt in the place where the ashes are poured out. And if all the multitude of Israel be ignorant, and through ignorance do that which is against the commandment of our Lord, and afterwards understand their sin, they shall offer for their sin a calf, and shall bring it to the door of the tabernacle. And the ancients of the people shall put their hands upon the head thereof before our Lord. And the calf being immolated in the sight of our Lord, the Priest that is anointed shall carry of the blood into the tabernacle of testimony, dipping his finger, &amp; sprinkling seven times against the veil, and he shall put of the same blood on the horns of the altar, that is before our Lord, in the tabernacle of testimony: and the rest of the blood, he shall pour at the foot of the altar of holocaust, which is at the door of the tabernacle of testimony. And all the fat thereof he shall take up, &amp; shall burn it upon the altar: doing so with this calf, as he did also before: &amp; the Priest praying for them, our Lord will be propitious unto them. But the calf itself he shall carry forth without the camp, and shall burn it like as the former calf: because it is for the sin of the multitude. If a Prince sin, and by ignorance do of many things one, that by the law of our Lord is forbidden: and afterwards understandeth his sin, he shall offer an host to our Lord, a buck of the goats without spot. And he shall put his hand upon the head thereof: and when he hath immolated it in the place where holocaust is wont to be slain before our Lord, because it is for sin, the Priest shall dip his fingers in the blood of the host for sin, touching the horns of the altar of holocaust, and the rest pouring at the foot thereof. But the fat he shall burn upon it, as is wont to be done in the victims of pacifics: and the Priest shall pray for him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. And if a soul of the people of the land shall sin through ignorance, doing any of those things that by the law of our Lord are forbidden, and offending, and knoweth his sin, he shall offer a she goat without spot. And he shall put his hand upon the head of the host that is for sin, and shall immolate it in the place of holocaust. And the Priest shall take up of the blood with his finger: and touching the horns of the altar of holocaust, the rest he shall pour out at the foot thereof. But taking away all the fat, as is wont to be taken away of the victims of pacifics, he shall burn it upon the altar, for a sweet savour to our Lord; and he shall pray for him, and it shall be forgiven him. But if he offer of the flock a victim for his sin, to wit, an ewe without spot, he shall put his hand upon the head thereof, and shall immolate it in the place where the hosts of holocausts are wont to be slain. And the Priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and touching the horns of the altar of holocaust, the rest he shall pour at the foot thereof. All the fat also he shall take away, as the fat of the ram, that is offered for pacifics, is wont to be taken away: and shall burn it upon the altar, a burnt sacrifice of our Lord: and he shall pray for him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.</div>
