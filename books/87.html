			<div class='roleText'>And Beseleel made also the ark of the wood setim, having two cubits &amp; an half in length, and a cubit and an half in breadth, the height also was of one cubit and an half: and he plated it with the purest gold within &amp; without. And he made to it a crown of gold round about, casting four rings of gold at the four corners thereof: two rings in the one side, and two in the other. Bars also he made of the wood setim, which he plated with gold, and which he put into the rings, that were at the sides of the ark to carry it. He made also the Propitiatory, that is, the Oracle, of the purest gold, two cubits &amp; an half in length, and a cubit &amp; an half in breadth. Two Cherubins also of beaten gold, which he set on either side of the propitiatory: One Cherub in the top of one side, and the other Cherub in the top of the other side: two Cherubins in each top of the Propitiatory, spreading their wings, and covering the Propitiatory, and looking one toward the other and toward it. He made also the table of the wood setim in length two cubits, and in breadth one cubit, which had in height a cubit and an half. And he did compass it with the finest gold, and he made to it a golden ledge round about, and to the ledge itself a golden crown interpolished of four fingers, &amp; upon the same another golden crown. And he cast four rings of gold, which he put in the four corners at every foot of the table against the crown: &amp; he put the bars into them, that the table might be carried. The bars also themselves he made of the wood setim, and compassed them with gold. And the vessels for the diverse uses of the table, saucers, phials, and goblets, &amp; censers, of pure gold, wherein the libaments are to be offered. He made also the candlestick beaten of the finest gold. From the shaft whereof the branches, cups, &amp; bowls &amp; lilies did proceed: six on both sides, three branches on one side, &amp; three on the other: three cups in manner of a nut on every branch, and bowls withal and lilies, and three cups of the fashion of a nut in another branch, and bowls withal and lilies. The work of the six branches, that proceeded from the shaft of the candlestick, equal. And in the shaft itself were four cups after the manner of a nut, and bowls withal at every one and lilies: and bowls under two branches in three places, which together make six branches proceeding from one shaft. Both the bowls therefore, &amp; the branches were out of it, all beaten of the purest gold. He made also the seven lamps with their snuffers, and the vessels, where the snuffings should be put out, of most pure gold. The candlestick withal the vessels thereof did weigh a talent of gold. He made also the altar of incense of the wood setim, having a cubit every way four square, and in height two: from the corners whereof the horns did proceed. And he plated it with the purest gold, with the grate and the walls and the horns. And he made to it a crown of gold round about, and two golden rings under the crown at either side, that the bars may be put into them, and the altar may be carried. And the bars themselves he made also of the wood setim, and covered them with plates of gold. He compounded also oil for the ointment of sanctification, and incense of the purest spices with the work of a pigmentary.</div>
