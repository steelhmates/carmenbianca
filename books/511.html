			<div class='roleText'>Hast thou known the time when the wild goats bring forth young among the rocks, or hast thou observed the hinds when they fawn? Hast thou numbered the months of their conceiving, and known the time of their bearing? They bow down themselves to bring forth young, and they cast them, and make roarings. Their young are separated, and go to feed: they go forth, and return not to them. Who hath dismist the wild ass free, and who hath loosed his bonds? To whom I have given a house in the wilderness, and his tabernacles in the land of saltness. He contemneth the multitude of the city, the cry of the exactor he heareth not. He looketh about the mountains of his pasture, and seeketh out all green places. Will the Rhinoceros serve thee, and will he tarry at thy stall? Shalt thou tie the Rhinoceros with thy collar to plough, or will he break the clods of the valleys after thee? Shalt thou have confidence in his great strength, and leave thy labours unto him? Wilt thou credit him that he will render thee the seed, and gather together thy barn floor? The wing of the Ostrich is like to the wings of the Herodius, and of the hawk. When she leaveth her eggs on the earth, thou perhaps wilt heat them in the dust. She forgeteth that foot may tread upon them, or beast of the field break them. She is hardened toward her young, as though they were not hers, she hath laboured in vain no fear compelling her. For God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he given her understanding. When time shall be, she setteth up the wings on high: she scorneth the horse and his rider. Shalt thou give strength to the horse, or put neighing about his neck? Shalt thou raise him up as Locusts? The glory of his nostrils is terror. He diggeth the earth with his hoof, he pranceth boldly, he goeth forward to meet the armed men. He contemneth fear, neither yieldeth he to the sword. Upon him shall the quiver sound, the spear shall glister and the shield. Fervent and fuming he suppeth the earth, neither doth he make account when the noise of the trumpet soundeth. When he shall hear the trumpet he saith: Vah, he smelleth battle far off, the exhortation of the captains, and the cry of the army. Doth the hawk wax feathered by thy wisdom, spreading her wings to the South? Shall the eagle mount at thy commandment, and put her nest in high places? She abideth in rocks, and tarrieth among cragged flints, and stony hills where is no access. Thence she beholdeth the prey, and her eyes see a far off. Her young ones shall lick blood: and wheresoever the carcass shall be, she is present by and by. And our Lord added, and spake to Job: He that contendeth with God is he quieted so easily? Verily he that reproveth God, ought to answer him. But Job answering our Lord, said: I that have spoken lightly what can I answer? I will put my hand upon my mouth. One thing I have spoken, which I would I had not said: </div>
