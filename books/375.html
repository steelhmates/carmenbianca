			<div class='roleText'>And twenty years being complete after that Salomon built the house of our Lord, and his own house: he built the cities, which Hiram had given to Salomon, and made the children of Israel dwell there. He went also into Emath Suba, and obtained it. And he built Palmira in the desert, and he built other cities very well fenced in Emath. And he built Beth horon the upper, and Beth horon the nether, walled cities having gates and barrigates and locks. Balaath also and all the strongest cities that were Salomon's, and all the cities of the chariots, and the cities of the horsemen. All things whatsoever Salomon would, and disposed, he built in Jerusalem, and in Libanus, and in all the land of his dominion. All the people that was left of the Hetheites, &amp; Amorrheites, &amp; Pherezites, and Heveites, &amp; Jebuseites, which were not of the stock of Israel, of their children, &amp; of the posterity, which the children of Israel had not slain, Salomon subdued to be tributaries, until this day. Moreover of the children of Israel he set not to serve the king's works: for they were men of war, and the chief Captains, and Princes of his chariots, and horsemen. And all the Princes of king Salomon's army were two hundred fifty, which taught the people. But the daughter of Pharao he removed from the city of David, into the house which he had built for her.

Then Salomon offered holocausts to our Lord upon the altar of our Lord, which he had built before the porch, that every day there might be offering on it, according to the precept of Moyses in the Sabbaths, and in the Calends, and in the festival days thrice a year, that is to say, in the Solemnity of Azymes, and in the Solemnity of weeks, and in the Solemnity of tabernacles. And he appointed according to the disposition of David his father the offices of the Priests in their ministries: and the Levites, in their order, that they should praise, and minister before the Priests according to the rite of every day: and the porters in their divisions by gate and gate: for so David the man of God had commanded. Neither did they transgress of the king's commandments as well the Priests as the Levites, touching all things, that he had commanded, and in the custodies of the treasures. Salomon had all expenses prepared, from the day that he founded the house of our Lord, until the day wherein he perfited it. Then went Salomon into Asiongaber, and into Ailath to the coast of the Red sea, which is in the Land of Edom. And Hiram sent unto him by the hands of his servants, ships, and cunning mariners, and they went with Salomon's servants into Ophir, and they took from thence four hundred fifty talents of gold, and brought it to king Salomon.</div>
