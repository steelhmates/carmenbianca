			<div class='roleText'>And these are the Priests and Levites, that came up with Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Josue: Saraia, Jeremias, Esdras, Amaria, Melluch, Hattus. Sebenias, Rheum, Merimuth, Addo, Genthon, Abia, Miamin, Madia, Belga, Semeia, and Joiarib, Idaia, Sellum, Amoc, Helcias, Idaia. These are the Princes of the Priests, &amp; their brethren in the days of Josue. Moreover the Levites, Jesua, Bennui, Cedmihel, Sarebia, Juda, Mathanias, over the hymns^ they &amp; their brethren: And Becbecia, and Hannia and their brethren every one in his office. And Josue begat Ioacim, and Ioacim begat Eliasib, and Eliasib begat Joiada, and Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Ieddoa. And in the days of Ioacim the Priests and Princes of the families were: Of Saraia, Maraia: Of Jeremias, Hanania: Of Esdras, Mosollam: Of Amaria, Johanan: Of Milicho, Jonathan: Of Sebenia, Joseph: Of Haram, Edna: Of Maraioth, Helci: Of Adaia, Zacharia: Of Genthon, Mosollam: Of Abia, Zechri: Of Miamin and Moadia, Phelti: Of Belga, Sammua: Of Semaia, Jonathan: Of Joiarib, Mathanai: Of Iodaia, Azzi: Of Sellai, Celai: Of Amoc, Heber: Of Helcias, Hasebia: Of Idaia, Nathanael. The Levites in the days of Eliasib, and Joiada, and Johanan, and Ieddoa, written Princes of the families, and the Priests in the reign of Darius the Persian. The children of Levi, Princes of the families, written in the book of Chronicles of days, and unto the days of Jonathan the son of Eliasib. And the Princes of the Levites, Hasebia, Serebia, and Josue the son of Cedmihel: and their brethren by their courses, to praise and confess according to the precept of David the man of God, and to wait equally in order. Mathania, and Becbecia, Obedia, and Mosollam, Telmon, Accub, keepers of the gates and of the entrances before the gates. These were in the days of Ioacim the son of Josue, the son Josedec, and in the days of Nehemias the duke, and of Esdras the Priest, and Scribe. And in the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought Levites out of all other places, to bring them into Jerusalem, and to make the dedication and joy in giving of thanks, and song, and in cymbals, psalteries and harps. And the children of the singing men were gathered together out of the champion about Jerusalem, and out of the towns Nethuphati, and from the house of Galgal, and from the countries of Geba and Azmaveth: because the singing men did build themselves villages round about Jerusalem. And the Priests and Levites were cleansed, and they cleansed the people, and the gates, &amp; the wall. And I made the Princes of Juda go up upon the wall, and I set two great choirs of them that should praise. And they went on the right hand upon the wall to the gate of the dunghill. And after them went Osaias, &amp; the half part of the Princes of Juda, and Azarias, Esdras, &amp; Mosollam, Judas, &amp; Benjamin, &amp; Semeia, &amp; Jeremias. And of the children of the Priests with trumpets, Zacharias the son of Jonathan, the son of Semeia, the son of Mathania, the son of Michaia, the son Zechur, the son Asaph, and his brethren Semeia, and Azareel, Malalai, Galalai, Maai, Nathanael, and Judas, and Hanani, with the instruments of the song of David the man of God: and Esdras the scribe before them in the gate of the fountain. And against them there went up in the stairs of the city of David, in the rising of the wall above the house of David, and unto the gate of waters toward the East. And the second choir of thanks-givers went on the contrary side, and I after it, &amp; the half part of the people upon the wall, &amp; above the tower of the furnaces, and unto the broadest wall, and above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate, and above the gate of fishes and the tower of Hananeel, and the tower of Emath, and unto the gate of the flock: and they stood in the gate of the watch, and there stood two choirs of them that praised in the house of God, and I, and the half part of the magistrates with me. And the Priests, Eliachim, Maasia, Miamin, Michea, Elioenai, Zacharia, Hanania with trumpets, and Maasia, &amp; Semeia, &amp; Eleazar, &amp; Azzi, &amp; Johanan, and Melchia, and Aelam, and Ezer. And the singing men sang aloud, and Iezraia the overseer: and they immolated in that day great victims, and rejoiced: for God had made them joyful with great joy: yea their wives also &amp; children rejoiced, &amp; the joy of Jerusalem was heard far off. They numbered also in that day men over the storehouses of the treasure, for the libaments, and for the first fruits, &amp; for the tithes, that the Princes of the city might bring in by them in the honour of thanks-giving, Priests and Levites: because Juda was made joyful in the Priests and Levites standing by. And they kept the watch of their God, and the observance of expiation, and the singing men, and the porters, according to the precept of David, and of Salomon his son, because in the days of David and Asaph from the beginning there were Princes appointed of the singing men in song praising, and confessing to God. And all Israel, in the days of Zorobabel, and in the days of Nehemias gave portions to the singing men, and to the porters day by day, and they sanctified the Levites, and the Levites sanctified the children of Aaron.</div>
