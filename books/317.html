The woman therefore went, and shut the door upon her, and upon her sons: they brought her vessels, and she poured in. And when the vessels were full, she said to her son: Bring me yet a vessel. And he answered: I have none. And the oil stood. And she came, and told the man of God. And he said: </div>

Who said to her husband: I perceive that this is a holy man of God, which passeth by us often. Let us therefore make him a little chamber, and set him a little bed in it, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick, that when he cometh to us he may tarry there. There came therefore a certain day, and coming he turned in to the chamber, and rested there. And he said to Giezi his servant: Call this Sunamite. Who when he had called her, and she stood before him, he said to his servant: Speak to her: Behold thou hast diligently ministered to us in all things, what wilt thou that I do for thee? Hast thou any business, and wilt thou that I speak to the king, or the general of the warfare? Who answered: I dwell in the midst of mine own people. And he said: </div>

He therefore commanded him to call her: who when she was called, and stood before the door, he said to her: At this time, this self same hour, if life accompany, thou shalt have a son in thy womb. But she answered: Do not I beseech thee my lord, man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid. And the woman conceived, and brought forth a son in that time, and in the self-same hour, that Eliseus had said. And the child grew. And upon a certain day, when going forth he went to his father, unto the reapers, he said to his father: My head acheth, my head acheth. But he said to his servant, take him, and bring him to his mother, who when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, she set him upon her knees until noon, and he died. And she went up, and laid him upon the bed of the man of God, and shut the door: and going forth. called her husband, and said: </div>

The Calends be not today, nor the Sabbath. Who answered: I will go. And she saddled the ass, and commanded her servant: drive, and make haste, make no stay in going. And do that which I command thee. She therefore went forward, and came to the man of God into mount Carmel: and when the man of God saw her over against him, he said to Giezi his servant: Behold that Sunamite. Go therefore to meet her, &amp; say to her: Is all well about thee &amp; about thy husband, and about thy son? Who answered: Well.

If a man meet thee, salute him not: and if any man salute thee, answer him not: and thou shalt put my staff upon the face of the child. Moreover the mother of the child said: </div>

But he returning, walked up and down in the house, once hither and thither: and he went up, and lay upon him: and the child gaped seven times, and opened his eyes.

And one went out into the field to gather wild herbs: and he found as it were a wild vine, and gathered of it the colocynthides of the field, and filled his mantle, and returning cut it into the pot of broth, for he knew not what it was. They therefore poured it to their fellows, to eat: and when they had tasted of the broth, they cried, saying: </div>
