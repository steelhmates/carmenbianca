			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm to David himself. Mercy and judgment I will sing to thee, o Lord: I will sing, and I shall understand in the immaculate way, when thou shalt come to me. I walked through in the innocency of my heart, in the midst of my house. I did not propose before mine eyes any unjust thing: I hated them that do prevarication. A perverse heart hath not cleaved to me: the malignant declining from me I knew not. One secretly detracting from his neighbour, him did I persecute. One of a proud eye, and unsatiable heart, with him I did not eat. Mine eyes are towards the faithful of the earth that they may sit with me. A man that walketh in the immaculate way he did minister to me. He that doth proudly shall not dwell in the midst of my house: he that speaketh unjust things, hath not directed in the sight of mine eyes. In the morning did I kill all the sinners of the earth: that I might destroy out of the city of our Lord all those that work iniquity.</div>
