			<div class='roleText'>Therefore all the companies of the Philisthiims were gathered together into Aphec: and Israel also camped upon the fountain, which was in Jezrahel. And the Princes indeed of the Philisthiims marched in hundreds and thousands: but David and his men were in the last company with Achis. And the Princes of the Philisthiims said to Achis: What mean these Hebrews?

Therefore arise in the morning, thou, and the servants of thy lord, which came with thee: and when you are risen in the night, and it shall begin to wax light, go forward. David therefore arose in the night, he and his men, that they might set forward in the morning, and return to the land of the Philisthiims: and the Philisthiims went up into Jezrahel.</div>
