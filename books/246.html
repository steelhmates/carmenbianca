			<div class='roleText'>Behold, our Lord hath anointed thee upon his inheritance to be Prince, and thou shalt deliver his people out of the hands of their enemies, that are round about them. And this shall be a sign unto thee, that God hath anointed thee to be Prince. When thou shalt be departed from me this day, thou shalt find two men beside the sepulchre of Rachel in the borders of Benjamin, in the South, and they shall say to thee: The asses are found, which thou didst go to see: and thy father letting go the asses, is careful for you, and saith: What shall I do concerning my son? And when thou shalt depart thence, and pass farther, and shalt come to the oak Thabor, three men going up to God into Bethel shall find thee there, one carrying three kids, and another three manchets of bread, and another carrying a flagon of wine. And when they have saluted thee, they will give thee two loaves, and thou shalt take them of their hand. After these things thou shalt come into the hill of God, where the garrison of the Philisthiims is: and when thou shalt be entered there into the city, thou shalt meet there a flock of Prophets coming down from the excelse, and before them psaltery and timbrel, and shalm, and harp, and themselves prophesying. And the Spirit of our Lord shall seize upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shalt be changed into another man. Therefore when all these signs shall chance to thee, do whatsoever thy hand shall find, because our Lord is with thee. And thou shalt go down before me into Galgala (for I will come down to thee) that thou mayest offer oblation, and immolate pacific victims: seven days shalt thou expect, till I come to thee, &amp; I will shew thee what thou must do. Therefore when he had turned away his shoulder to depart from Samuel, God changed unto him another heart, and all these things came in that day. And they came to the foresaid hill, and behold a troop of Prophets meeting him: &amp; the Spirit of our Lord seized upon him, and he prophesied in the midst of them. And all that had known him yesterday and the day before, seeing that he was with the prophets, &amp; did prophesy, said to each other: What thing hath happened to the son of Cis? What^ is Saul also among the Prophets? And one answered another, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>And who is there father? Therefore it was turned into a proverb: What^ is Saul also among the Prophets? And he ceased to prophesy, and came to the excelse. And Saul's uncle said to him, and to his servant: Whither went you? Who answered: To seek the asses: which when we had not found we came to Samuel. And his uncle said to him: Tell me what Samuel said to thee. And Saul said to his uncle: He told us that the asses were found. But concerning the word of the Kingdom which Samuel had spoken to him, he told him not. And Samuel called together the people of our Lord in Maspha: And said to the children of Israel: Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: I brought Israel out of Aegypt, and delivered you from the hand of the Aegyptians, and from the hand of all the kings which afflicted you. But you this day have rejected your God, who only hath saved you out of all your evils and tribulations: and you have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Not so: but appoint a king over us. Now therefore stand before our Lord by your tribes, and by your families. And Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel, and the lot fell on the tribe of Benjamin. And he brought the tribe of Benjamin and the kindreds thereof, &amp; it fell upon the kindred of Metri, and it came unto Saul the son of Cis. They therefore sought him, and he was not found. And after these things they consulted our Lord whether he would come thither. And our Lord answered: Behold he is hid at home. They ran therefore and took him from thence: and he stood in the midst of the people, and he was higher than all the people from the shoulder and upward. And Samuel said to all the people: Certes you see whom our Lord hath chosen, that there is not the like to him in all the people. And all the people cried, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>God save the king. And Samuel spake to the people the law of the Kingdom, and wrote it in a book, and laid it up before our Lord: and Samuel dismissed all the people, every one into his own house. But Saul also departed into his house into Gabaa: &amp; there went with him part of the army, they whose hearts God had touched. But the children of Belial said: </div>
