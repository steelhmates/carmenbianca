And the Pharisees coming near, asked him: Is it lawful for a man to dismiss his wife? Tempting him. But he answering, said to them: What did Moyses command you? Who said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>For the hardness of your heart he wrote you this precept. But from the beginning of the creation God made them male &amp; female. For this cause, man shall leave his father &amp; mother; and shall cleave to his wife. And they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. That therefore which God hath joined together, let no man separate. And in the house again his Disciples asked him of the same thing. And he saith to them: Whosoever dismisseth his wife and marrieth another, committeth adultery upon her. And if the wife dismiss her husband, and marry another, she committeth adultery. And they offered to him young children, that he might touch them. And the Disciples threatened those that offered them. Whom when JESUS saw, he took it ill, and said to them: Suffer the little children to come unto me, and prohibit them not. For the Kingdom of God is for such. Amen I say to you, whosoever receiveth not the Kingdom of God as a little child, shall not enter into it. And embracing them, and imposing hands upon them, he blessed them. And when he was gone forth in the way, a certain man running forth &amp; kneeling before him asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may receive life everlasting? And JESUS said to him, why callest thou me good? None is good but one, God. Thou knowest the commandments, Commit not adultery, Kill not, Steal not, Bear not false witness, do no fraud, Honour thy father and mother. But he answering, said to him: Master all these things I have observed from my youth. And JESUS beholding him, loved him, and said to him: One thing is wanting unto thee: go, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow me. Who being stroken sad at the word, went away sorrowful. For he had many possessions. And JESUS looking about, saith to his Disciples: How hardly shall they that have money, enter into the Kingdom of God! And the Disciples were astonished at his words. But JESUS again answering, saith to them: Children, how hard is it for them that trust in money, to enter into the Kingdom of God! It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God. Who marveled more, saying to themselves: And who can be saved? And JESUS beholding them saith: With men it is impossible; but not with God. For all things are possible with God. And Peter began to say unto him: Behold, we have left all things, and have followed thee. JESUS answering, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Amen I say to you, there is no man which hath left house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or children, or lands for me and for the Gospel, that shall not receive an hundred times so much now in this time; houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions: and in the world to come life everlasting. But many that are first, shall be last; and the last, first. And they were in the way going up to Jerusalem: and JESUS went before them, and they were astonished; and following were afraid. And taking again the Twelve, he began to tell them the things that should befall him. That, behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of man shall be betrayed to the chief Priests, and to the Scribes and Ancients, and they shall condemn him to death, and shall deliver him to the Gentiles. and they shall mock him, and spit on him, and scourge him, and kill him, and the third day he shall rise again. And there came to him James and John the sons of Zebedee, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Grant to us, that we may sit, one on thy right hand &amp; the other on thy left hand, in thy glory. And JESUS said to them: You wot not what you ask. Can you drink the cup that I drink; or be baptized with the baptism wherewith I am baptized? But they said to him, we can. And JESUS said to them: The cup indeed which I drink, you shall drink; and with the Baptism wherewith I am baptized, shall you be baptized: but to sit on my right hand or on my left, is not mine to give unto you, but to whom it is prepared. And the ten hearing, began to be displeased at James and John. And JESUS calling them, saith to them: You know that they which seem to rule over the Gentiles, overrule them: and their Princes have power over them. But it is not so in you. But whosoever will be greater, shall be your minister; and whosoever will be first among you, shall be the servant of all. For the Son of man also is not come to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a redemption for many. And they come to Jericho: and when he departed from Jericho, and his Disciples, and a very great multitude, the son of Timaeus, Bar-timaeus the blind man, sat by the way side begging. Who when he had heard, that it is JESUS of Nazareth, he began to cry, and to say: JESUS, son of David, have mercy upon me. And many threatened him, to hold his peace. But he cried much more, Son of David, have mercy upon me. And JESUS standing still commanded him to be called. And they call the blind man, saying to him: Be of better comfort, arise, he calleth thee. Who casting off his garment leapt up, and came to him. And JESUS answering, said to him: What wilt thou that I do unto thee? And the blind man said to him: Rabboni, that I may see. And JESUS said to him: Go thy ways, thy faith hath made thee safe. And forthwith he saw, and followed him in the way.</div>
