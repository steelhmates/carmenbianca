			<div class='roleText'>AND after it was decreed that he should sail into Italy, and that Paul with other prisoners should be delivered to a Centurion named Julius, of the band Augusta, we going up into a ship of Adrumetum, beginning to sail about the places of Asia, loosed from the land, Aristarchus the Macedonian of Thessalonica continuing with us. And the third day following we came to Sidon. And Julius entreating Paul courteously, permitted him to go to his friends, and to take care of himself. And when we had loosed thence we sailed under Cypres: because the winds were contrary. And sailing the sea of Cilicia and Pamphilia, we came to Lystra, which is in Lycia: and there the Centurion finding a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy, removed us into it. And whereas many days we sailed slowly, and were scarce come over against Gnidus, the wind hindering us, we sailed near Crete by Salmone: and with much ado sailing by it, we came into a certain place that is called Good-havens, nigh to the which was a city Thalassa. And when much time was spent, and whereas now it was not safe sailing, because the fast now was past, Paul comforted them, saying to them: Ye men, I see that the sailing beginneth to be with hurt and much damage, not only of the lading and the ship, but also of our lives. But the Centurion believed the governor and master of the ship, more than those things which were said of Paul. And whereas it was not a commodious haven to winter in, very many taking counsel appointed to sail thence, if by any means they might coming to Phoenice, winter there, a haven of Crete looking toward the Afrike and the Chore. And the south-wind blowing, they thinking that they had obtained their purpose, when they had parted from Asson, sailed along by Crete. But not long after, a tempestuous wind that is called Euro-aquilo, drove against it. And when the ship was caught and could not make way against the wind, giving up the ship to the winds, we were driven, And running upon a certain Island, that is called Cauda, we could scarce get the cock-boat. Which being taken up, they used helps, girding the ship, and fearing lest they should fall into the Syrt, letting down the vessel, so were they carried. And when we were mightily tossed with the tempest, the next day they cast forth. And the third day with their own hands they threw forth the tacklings of the ship. And neither sun, nor stars appearing for many days, and no small storm being toward, all hope was now taken away of our saving. And when there had been long fasting, then Paul standing in the midst of them, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>You should indeed, O ye men, have heard me, and not have parted from Crete, &amp; have gained this hurt and loss. And now I exhort you to be of good cheer. For there shall be no loss of any soul among you, but of the ship. For an Angel of the God whose I am, and whom I serve, stood by me this night, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Fear not Paul, thou must appear before Caesar: and behold God hath given thee all that sail with thee. For the which cause be of good cheer ye men: for I believe God, that it shall so be, as it hath been said to me. And we must come unto a certain island. But after the fourteenth night was come on us, as we were sailing in Adria about mid-night, the ship-men deemed that there appeared some country to them. Who also sounding, found twenty fathoms: and being parted a little from thence, they found fifteen fathoms. And fearing lest we should fall into rough places, casting out of the stern four anchors, they wished that day were come. But as the ship-men sought to fly out of the ship, having let down the cock-boat into the sea, pretending as if they were about to cast out anchors out of the fore-part of the ship, Paul said to the Centurion and to the soldiers: unless these tarry in the ship you cannot be saved. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the cock-boat; and suffered it to fall away. And when it began to be light, Paul desired all to take meat, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This day is the fourteenth day that you expect and remain fasting, taking nothing. For the which cause I desire you to take meat for your health sake: for there shall not an hair of the head perish of any of you. And when he had said these things, taking bread he gave thanks to God in the sight of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat. And being all made of better cheer, they also took meat. And we were in all in the ship, souls two hundred seventy six. And being filled with meat, they lighted the ship, casting the wheat into the sea. And when day was come, they knew not the land: but they spied a certain creek that had a shore, into the which they minded, if they could, to cast aland the ship. And when they had taken up the anchors, they committed themselves to the sea, loosing withal the rudder bands: and hoisting up the main sail according as the wind blew, they went on toward the shore. And when we were fallen into a place between two seas, they graveled the ship: and the fore-part truly sticking fast remained unmoveable: but the hinder-part was broken by the violence of the sea. And the counsel of the soldiers was, that they should kill the prisoners: lest any swimming out, might run away. But the Centurion willing to save Paul, forbade it to be done: &amp; he commanded them that could swim, to cast out themselves first, and escape, and go forth to land: and the rest, some they carried on boards, &amp; some upon those things that were of the ship. And so it came to pass, that all the souls escaped to land.</div>
