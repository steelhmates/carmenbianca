			<div class='roleText'>That day king Assuerus gave unto Esther the queen the house of Aman the Jews' adversary, and Mardocheus went in before the king's presence. For Esther confessed to him that he was her uncle. And the king took the ring, which he had commanded to be taken again from Aman, and delivered it to Mardocheus. And Esther appointed Mardocheus also over her house. Neither content with these things, she fell down at the king's feet, and she wept and speaking to him prayed him, that he would command that the malice of Aman the Agagite, and his most wicked devices, which he had invented against the Jews, should be of none effect. But he after the manner put forth the golden sceptre with his hand, by the which the sign of clemency was shewed: and she rising up stood before him, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>If it please the king, and if I have found grace in his eyes, and my request seem not contrary to him, I beseech thee, that the old letters of Aman the traitor and enemy of the Jews, wherein he commanded that in all the king's provinces they should perish, may by new letters be corrected. For how can I abide the murder and slaughter of my people? And king Assuerus answered Esther the queen, and Mardocheus the Jew: Aman's house I have given to Esther, and himself I have commanded to be hanged on the gallows, because he durst lay hands on the Jews. Write ye therefore to the Jews as pleaseth you, in the king's name, signing the letters with my ring. For this was the custom, that no man durst speak against the letters, which were sent in the king's name, and were signed with his ring. And the king's scribes and secretaries being called for (and it was the time of the third month, which is called Siban) the three and twentieth day thereof letters were written, as Mardocheus would, to the Jews, and to the Princes, &amp; the lieutenants and judges, which were rulers over the hundred and seven and twenty Provinces, from India even to Aethiopia: to Province and Province, to people and people, according to their languages and characters, and to the Jews, according as they could read, and hear. And the said letters, which were sent in the king's name, were signed with his ring, and sent by riding posts: which running through all the Provinces, should prevent the old letters with the new messages. To whom the king gave commandment, that they should speak to the Jews in every city, and should command them to be gathered together in one, that they might stand for their lives, and might kill and destroy all their enemies with their wives and children and all their houses, and to take the spoil of them. And there was appointed through all the Provinces one day of revenge, that is, the thirteenth of the twelfth month Adar. And this was the content of the letter, that in all lands and peoples which were subject to the empire of king Assuerus, it should be notified, the Jews to be ready to be revenged of their enemies. And there went forth swift posts carrying the messages, and the king's edict hung in Susan. But Mardocheus going forth out of the palace, and from the king's presence, shining in royal garments, to wit, hyacinthine and sky colour, bearing a golden crown on his head, and clothed with a silk and purple cloak. And the city rejoiced, and was glad. But to the Jews there seemed a new light to rise, joy, honour, and dancing. With all peoples, cities, and Provinces, whither soever the king's commandments came, marvelous rejoicing, feasts and banquets, and holy day: in so much that many of the other nation and sect, were joined to their religion and ceremonies. For great terror of the name of the Jews had invaded them all.</div>
