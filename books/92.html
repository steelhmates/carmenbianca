			<div class='roleText'>When a soul shall offer an oblation of sacrifice to our Lord, fine flour shall be his oblation, and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense, and shall carry it to the sons of Aaron the Priests: of whom one shall take a handful of the flour, and the oil, and all the frankincense, and shall put it a memorial upon the Altar for a most sweet savour to our Lord. And that which shall be left of the sacrifice, shall be Aaron's, &amp; his sons', Holy of holies among the oblations of our Lord. But when thou offerest a sacrifice baked in the oven: of flour, to wit, loaves without leaven, tempered with oil, and wafers unleavened laid over with oil. If thine oblation be of the frying pan, of flour tempered with oil, and without leaven, thou shalt divide it into little pieces, and shalt pour oil upon it. And if the sacrifice be from the gridiron, in like manner the flour shall be tempered with oil, which offering to our Lord, thou shalt deliver to the hands of the Priest. Who having offered it shall take a memory of the sacrifice, and burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour to our Lord, and whatsoever is left, shall be Aaron's, and his sons, Holy of holies among the oblations of our Lord. Every oblation that is offered to our Lord, shall be made without leaven, neither shall any leaven and honey be burned in the sacrifice of our Lord. The first fruits only of them and the gifts you shall offer: but upon the altar they shall not be put, for a savour of sweetness. What sacrifice soever thou offerest, thou shalt season it with salt, neither shalt thou take away the salt of the covenant of thy God from thy sacrifice. In every oblation thou shalt offer salt. But if thou offer a gift of the first fruits of thy corn to our Lord, of the ears being yet green, thou shalt dry it at the fire, and bruise it in manner of meal, and so shalt thou offer thy first fruits to our Lord, pouring oil upon it, and putting on frankincense, because it is the oblation of our Lord. Whereof the Priest shall burn for memory of the gift, part of the meal bruised, and of the oil, and all the frankincense.</div>
