			<div class='roleText'>Say to the children of Israel: these are the beasts which you ought to eat of all the living things of the earth. Every one that hath the hoof divided, and cheweth the cud among the cattle, you shall eat. But whatsoever indeed cheweth the cud, and hath an hoof, but divideth it not, as the camel, and others, that you shall not eat, and among the unclean you shall repute it. Cherogril which cheweth the cud, and divideth not the hoof, is unclean. The hare also: for that also cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof. And the swine: which though it divideth the hoof, cheweth not the cud. The flesh of these you shall not eat, nor touch their carcasses, because they are unclean to you. These are the things that breed in the waters, and which it is lawful to eat. All that hath fins, and scales, as well in the sea, as in the rivers, and the pools, you shall eat. But whatsoever hath not fins and scales, of those that move and live in the waters, shall be unto you abominable, and execrable, their flesh you shall not eat, and their carcasses you shall avoid. All that have not fins and scales in the waters, shall be polluted. Of birds these are they which you must not eat, and are to be avoided of you: The Eagle, and the griffon, and the osprey, and the kite, and the vulture according to his kind, and every one of the raven's kind, according to their similitude, the ostrich, and the owl, and the stern, and the hawk according to his kind, the screech-owl, &amp; the diver, and the stork, and the swan, and the onocratal, and the porphirion, the herodian, &amp; the charadrion according to his kind, the lapwing also, and the bat. Of fowls every one that goeth upon four feet, shall be abominable to you. And whatsoever walketh upon four feet, but hath the legs behind longer, wherewith he hoppeth upon the earth, that you shall eat, as is the bruke in his kind, the attake, and the ophiomach, and the locust, every one according to their kind. But of fowl whatsoever hath four feet only, shall be execrable to you: and whatsoever shall touch the carcasses of them, shall be polluted, and shall be unclean until even: and if it be necessary that he carry any of these that be dead, he shall wash his cloths, and shall be unclean until sun set. Every beast that hath a hoof, but divideth it not, neither cheweth the cud, shall be unclean: and whatsoever toucheth it, shall be defiled. That which walketh upon hands of all beasts, which go on four feet, shall be unclean: he that toucheth their carcases shall be polluted until even. And he that carrieth such carcasses, shall wash his cloths, and shall be unclean until even: because all these things are unclean to you. These also shall be reputed among polluted things, of all that move upon the earth, the weasel and the mouse and the crocodile, every one according to their kind, the mygale, and the chameleon, and the stellion, and the lizard, and the mole: all these are unclean. He that toucheth their carcasses, shall be unclean until even: and that whereupon any thing of their carcasses falleth, shall be polluted, as well vessel of wood and raiment, as skins and hair cloths: and in whatsoever vessel any work is done, they shall be dipped in water, and shall be polluted until even, and so afterward shall be clean. But the earthen vessel, whereinto any of these falleth within it, shall be polluted, and therefore is to be broken. All meat, which you shall eat, if the water be poured upon it, shall be unclean; and all liquor that is drunk of all vessel, shall be unclean. And upon whatsoever ought of such carcasses falleth, it shall be unclean: whether ovens, or pots with feet, they shall be destroyed, and shall be unclean. But the fountains and the cisterns, and all collection of waters shall be clean. He that toucheth their carcass, shall be polluted. If it fall upon seed corn it shall not pollute it. But if any man pour water upon the seed, and afterward it be touched with the carcasses, it shall be forthwith polluted. If a beast be dead, of which it is lawful for you to eat, he that toucheth the carcass thereof, shall be unclean until even: and he that eateth or carrieth any thing thereof shall wash his cloths, &amp; shall be unclean until even. All that creepeth upon the earth, shall be abominable, neither shall it be taken for meat. Whatsoever goeth upon the breast on four feet, &amp; hath many feet, or traileth on the earth, you shall not eat, because it is abominable. Do not contaminate your souls, nor touch ought thereof, lest you be unclean. For I am the Lord your God: be holy, because I am holy. Pollute not your souls in any creeping beast, that moveth upon the earth. For I am the Lord, that brought you out of the Land of Aegypt, that I might be your God. You shall be holy because I am holy. This is the law of beasts and fowls, and of every living soul, that moveth in the waters, and creepeth on the earth, that you may know the differences of the clean, and the unclean, and know what you ought to eat, and what to refuse.</div>
