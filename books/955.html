			<div class='roleText'>And he brought me into the temple, and he measured the fronts six cubits of breadth on this side, and six cubits of breadth on that side, the breadth of the tabernacle. And the breadth of the gate was ten cubits: and the sides of the gate of five cubits on this side, and of five cubits on that side: and he measured the length thereof of forty cubits, and the breadth of twenty cubits. And being entered within he measured in the front of the gate, two cubits: and the gate of six cubits: and the breadth of the gate of seven cubits. And he measured the length thereof of twenty cubits, and the breadth of twenty cubits, before the face of the temple: and he said to me: This is Sanctum Sanctorum. And he measured the wall of the house of six cubits: and the breadth of a side, of four cubits on every side round about the house. And the sides, side to side, were twice thirty three: and they were eminent, which might enter in through the wall of the house, in the sides round about, to hold in, and not to touch the wall of the temple. And there was a broad alley made round, ascending up by winding stairs, and it led into the upper chamber of the temple round about: therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts: and so from the lower parts they mounted to the higher unto the midst. And I saw in the house the height round about, the sides founded by the measure of a reed the space of six cubits: and the breadth through the wall of the side without of five cubits: and there was an inner house in the sides of the house. And between the cells the breadth of twenty cubits round about the house on every side, and the door of the side for prayer: one door to the way of the North, and one door to the way of the South: and the breadth of the place for prayer, of five cubits round about. And the building, that was separated, and turned to the way that looketh toward the sea, of the breadth of seventy cubits: and the wall of the building, of five cubits in breadth round about: and the length thereof of ninety cubits. And he measured the length of the house, of an hundred cubits: and the building that was separated, and the walls thereof, of the length of an hundred cubits. And the breadth before the face of the house, and of that which was separated against the East, of an hundred cubits. And he measured the length of the building against the face of that, which was separated at the back: the ethecks on both sides of an hundred cubits: and the inner temple, and the entries of the court. The thresholds, and oblique windows, &amp; the ethecks round about by three parts, against the threshold of every one, and paved with wood round about the circuit: and earth even to the windows, and the windows shut over the doors. And even to the inner house, and without by every wall round about within and without, by measure. And Cherubs and palmtrees wrought, &amp; a palmtree between Cherub &amp; Cherub, &amp; a Cherub had two faces. The face of a man by the palmtree on this side, and the face of a lion by the palmtree on the other side: expressed through all the house round about. From the ground even to the upper parts of the gate, were Cherubs, and palmtrees graven in the wall of the temple. The threshold four square, and the face of the sanctuary, sight to sight. The height of the wooden altar, of three cubits: and the length thereof, of two cubits: and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, &amp; the walls thereof of wood. And he spake to me: This is the table before our Lord. And there were two doors in the temple, and in the sanctuary. And in the two doors on both sides were two little doors, which were folded within each other: for there were two wickets on both sides of the doors. And there were Cherubs also graven in the same doors of the temple, and the graving of palmtrees, as they were expressed in the walls: for which cause also there was thicker timber in the front of the entry without. Upon which were the oblique windows, and the similitude of palmtrees on this side and on that side in braces of the entry: according to the sides of the house, and the breadth of the walls.</div>
