			<div class='roleText'>The hand of our Lord was made upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of our Lord: and left me in the midst of a field, that was full of bones. And he led me about through them on every side: and there were very many upon the face of the field, and exceeding dry. And he said to me: Son of man, thinkest thou these bones shall live? And I said, Lord God, thou knowest. And he said to me: Prophesy of these bones: and thou shalt say to them: Dry bones hear ye the word of our Lord. Thus saith our Lord God to these bones: Behold I will put spirit into you, and you shall live. And I will give sinews upon you, and will make flesh to grow up over you, and will stretch a skin on you: and I will give you spirit, and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord. And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and there was made a sound when I prophesied, and behold a commotion: and bones came to bones, every one to his juncture. And I saw, and behold upon them sinews, and flesh was grown up: and a skin was stretched out in them above, and they had no spirit. And he said to me: prophesy to the spirit, prophesy son of man, &amp; thou shalt say to the spirit: Thus saith our Lord God: Come spirit from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them be revived. And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and spirit entered into them, and they lived: and they stood upon their feet, an army passing great. And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones, are the house of Israel: They say: our bones are withered, our hope is perished, and we are cut off. Therefore prophesy, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith our Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres o my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, &amp; shall have brought you out of your graves o my people: and shall have given my spirit in you, &amp; you shall live, &amp; I shall make you rest upon your ground: &amp; you shall know that I^ the Lord have spoken &amp; done it, saith our Lord God. And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: And thou son of man, take thee one piece of wood, and write upon it: Of Juda, &amp; of the children of Israel his fellows: &amp; take another piece of wood, &amp; write upon it: Of Joseph the wood of Ephraim, and of all the house of Israel, and of his fellows. And join them, one to the other for thee into one piece of wood, and they shall be into an union in thy hand. And when the children of thy people shall say to thee speaking: Doest thou not declare unto us what thou meanest by these? Thou shalt speak to them: Thus saith our Lord God: Behold I will take the piece of wood of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, &amp; the tribes of Israel, that are adjoined to him: and I will give them together with the piece of wood of Juda, and will make them into one piece of wood: and they shall be one in his hand. And the pieces of wood whereupon thou shalt write, in thy hand, shall be before their eyes. And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith our Lord God: Behold I will take the children of Israel out of the midst of the nations, to which they are gone: and I will gather them together on every side, and will bring them to their ground. And I will make them into one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and there shall be one king ruling over them all: &amp; they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms. Neither shall they be polluted any more in their idols, &amp; their abominations, and all their iniquities, &amp; I will save them out of all the seats, in which they have sinned, &amp; I will cleanse them: &amp; they shall be my people, &amp; I will be their God. And my servant David king over them, &amp; there shall be one Pastor of them all, they shall walk in my judgements, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them. And they shall dwell upon the land, which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell upon it, themselves, &amp; their children, &amp; their children's children, even for ever: &amp; David my servant their Prince for ever. And I will make a league of peace to them, an everlasting covenant shall be to them: and I will found them, &amp; will multiply them, and will give my sanctification in the midst of them for ever. And my tabernacle shall be in them: &amp; I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And the Gentiles shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctification shall be in the midst of them for ever.</div>
