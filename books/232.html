			<div class='roleText'>None of us shall give of his daughters to the children of Benjamin to wife. And they came all to the house of God in Silo, and sitting in his sight until evening, lifted up their voice, &amp; with great wailing began to weep saying: Wherefore, o Lord God of Israel, is this evil done in thy people, that this day one tribe should be taken away out of us? And on the morrow rising early, they built an altar: and offered there holocausts, and pacific victims, and said: Who hath not ascended in the host of our Lord of all the tribes of Israel? For they had bound themselves with a great oath, when they were in Maspha, that they should be slain which had been wanting. And the children of Israel being moved with repentance upon their brother Benjamin, began to say: One tribe is taken away out of Israel, Whence shall they take wives? For we have all sworn in common, that we will not give our daughters to them. Therefore they said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Who is there of all the tribes of Israel, that went not up to our Lord into Maspha? And behold the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad were found not to have been in that army. (At that time also when they were in Silo, none of them was found there.) They sent therefore ten thousand the strongest men, and commanded them: Go, and strike the inhabitants of Jabes Galaad in the edge of the sword, as well their wives as their little ones. And this shall be it which you shall observe: All of the male kind, and woman that have known men, kill ye, but the virgins reserve. And there were found of Jabes Galaad four hundred virgins, that knew not man's bed, and they brought them to the camp in Silo, into the Land of Chanaan. And they sent messengers to the children of Benjamin, that were in the Rock Remmon, &amp; commanded them that they should receive them in peace. And the children of Benjamin came at that time, and there were given unto them wives of the daughters of Jabes Galaad: but others they found not, which they might give them in like manner. And all Israel was very sorry, and repented for the killing of one tribe out of Israel. And the ancients said: </div>

And we must very carefully, and with great study provide, that one tribe be not destroyed out of Israel. For our own daughters we cannot give them, being bound with an oath &amp; a curse, whereby we said: </div>

And when you shall see the daughters of Silo come forth after the manner to lead dances, issue forth suddenly out of the vineyards, &amp; catch of them every one his wife, and go into the Land of Benjamin. And when their fathers shall come, and their brethren, and shall begin to complain against you, and to chide, we will say to them: Have pity on them: for they took them not away by the right of warriors and conquerors, but when they desired to receive them, you gave them not, and on your part the fault was committed. And the children of Benjamin did as it had been commanded them: and according to their number they took away to themselves of those that led the dances, every one his wife: and they went into their possession, building cities, and dwelling in them. The children of Israel also returned by their tribes and families into their tabernacles. In those days there was not a king in Israel: but every one did that which seemed right to himself.</div>
