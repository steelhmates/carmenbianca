			<div class='roleText'>These therefore are the Princes of the families, and the genealogy of them, that came up with me in the reign of Artaxerxes the king out of Babylon. Of the children of Phinees, Gersom. Of the children of Ithamar, Daniel. Of the children of David, Hattus. Of the children of Sechenias, the children of Pharos, Zacharias: and with him were numbered an hundred fifty men. Of the children of Phahath Moab, Eleoenai the son of Zareha, and with him two hundred men. Of the children of Sechenias, the son of Ezechiel, and with him three hundred men. Of the children of Adan, Abed the son of Jonathan, and with him fifty men. Of the children of Alam, Isaias the son of Athalia, and with him seventy men. Of the children of Saphatia, Zebedia the son of Michael, and with him eighty men. Of the children of Joab, Obedia the son of Jahiel, and with him two hundred and eighteen men. Of the children of Selomith, the son of Josphia, and with him an hundred sixty men. Of the children of Bebai, Zacharias the son of Bebai: and with him twenty eight men. Of the children of Azgad, Ioanan the son of Eccetan, and with him an hundred and ten men. Of the children of Adonicam, which were the last: and these are their names: Elipheleth, and Jehiel, and Samaias, and with them sixty men. Of the children of Begui, Uthai and Zachur, and with them seventy men. And I gathered them to the river, which runneth down to Ahava, and we tarried there three days: and I sought among the people and among the Priests for the children of Levi, and found none there. Therefore I sent Eliezer, and Ariel, and Semeias, and Elnathan, &amp; Jarib, and another Elnathan, and Nathan, and Zacharias, and Mosollam Princes: and Joiarib, and Elnathan, wise men. And I sent them to Eddo, which is chief in the place of Chasphia, and I did put in their mouth the words that they should speak to Eddo, and his brethren the Nathineites in the place of Chasphia, that they should bring us ministers of the house of our God. And they brought us by the good hand of our God upon us a most learned man of the children of Mocholi the son of Levi the son of Israel, and Sarabias and his sons, and his brethren eighteen, and Hasabias, and with him Isaias of the children of Merari, and his brethren, and his sons twenty. And all the Nathineites, which David gave, and the Princes for the ministries of the Levites, Nathineites two hundred twenty: all these were called by their names. And I proclaimed there a fast beside the River of Ahava, that we might be afflicted before the Lord our God, and might desire of him a right way for us and our children, and all our substance. For I was ashamed to ask the king aid and horsemen, that might defend us from the enemy in the way: because we had said to the king: The hand of our God is upon all them, that seek him in goodness: and his empire and strength, and fury upon all them that forsake him. And we fasted, and besought our God hereby: and it fell out prosperously unto us. And I separated twelve of the chief Priests, Sarabias, and Hasabias, and with them ten of their brethren. And I weighed unto them the silver and gold, and the consecrated vessels of the house of our God, which the king had offered and his counsellers, and his Princes, and all Israel of them that were found: and I weighed in their hands of silver six hundred fifty talents, and vessels of silver an hundred, of gold an hundred talents: and cups of gold twenty, which had a thousand solids, and two vessels of the best shining brass, fair as gold. And I said to them: You are the holy of our Lord, and the vessels are holy, and the silver and gold, that is voluntarily offered to our Lord the God of our fathers: Watch &amp; keep it, until you deliver it by weight before the Princes of the Priests, and of the Levites, &amp; the Princes of the families of Israel in Jerusalem, into the treasure of the house of our Lord. And the Priests and the Levites received the weight of the silver and gold, and of the vessels, to carry it to Jerusalem into the house of our God. We therefore did set forward from the river of Ahava the twelfth day of the first month to go on to Jerusalem: and the hand of our God was upon us, &amp; delivered us from the hand of the enemy, and the lier in wait by the way. And we came to Jerusalem, and we tarried there three days. And in the fourth day the silver was weighed, and the gold, and the vessels in the house of our God by the hand of Meremoth the son of Urias the Priest, and with him Eleazar the son of Phinees, and with them Jozabed the son of Josue, and Noadaia the son of Bennoi^ Levites, according to the number and weight of all: and all the weight was described at that time. Yea &amp; the children of the transmigration that were come from the captivity, offered holocausts to the God of Israel, calves twelve for all the people of Israel, rams ninety six, lambs seventy seven, buck-goats for sin twelve: all for holocaust to our Lord. And they gave the king's edicts to the Princes, that were overseers for the king, and the dukes beyond the River, and they advanced the people and the house of God.</div>
