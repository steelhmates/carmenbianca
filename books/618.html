			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Confess ye to our Lord, and invocate his name: shew forth his works among the Gentiles. Chant to him, and sing to him: tell ye all his marvelous works. Praise ye him in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek our Lord. Seek ye our Lord, and be confirmed: seek his face always. Remember ye his marvelous works, which he hath done: his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth. The seed of Abraham his servants: the children of Jacob his elect. He is the Lord our God: in all the earth are his judgments. He hath been mindful for ever of his testament; of the word which he commanded unto a thousand generations. Which he disposed to Abraham: and of his oath to Isaac. And he appointed it to Jacob for a precept: and to Israel for an eternal testament, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>To thee will I give the land of Chanaan, the cord of your inheritance. When they were of small number, very few and sojourners thereof: And they passed from nation into nation, &amp; from Kingdom to another people. He left not a man to hurt them: and he rebuked kings for their sake: Touch not my anointed, and toward my Prophets be not malignant. And he called a famine upon the land: and he destroyed all the strength of bread. He sent a man before them: Joseph was sold to be a servant. They humbled his feet in fetters, iron passed through his soul, until his word came. The word of our Lord inflamed him: the king sent, and loosed him; the Prince of the people, and released him. He appointed him lord of his house: and Prince of all his possession. That he might instruct his Princes as himself: and might teach his ancients wisdom. And Israel entered into Aegypt, and Jacob was a sojourner in the land of Cham. And he increased his people exceedingly: and strengthened them over their enemies. He turned their heart that they hated his people: and to work guile toward his servants. He sent Moyses his servant: Aaron himself whom he chose. He did put in them the words of his signs, and of his wonders in the Land of Cham. He sent darkness, and obscured: and did not exasperate his words. He turned their waters into blood: and killed their fishes. Their land brought forth frogs in the inner chambers of their kings. He said, and the caenomyia came: and the sciniphs in all their coasts. He made their rains hail: fire burning in their land. And he struck their vines, and their fig-trees: and he destroyed the wood of their coasts. He said, &amp; the locust came, &amp; the bruchus whereof there was no number. And it did eat all the grass in their land: and it did eat all the fruit of their land. And he struck every first begotten in their land: the first fruits of all their labour. And he brought them forth with gold and silver, and there was not in their tribes a feeble person. Aegypt was glad at their departure: because the fear of them lay upon them. He spread a cloud for their protection, and fire to shine unto them by night. They made petition, and the quail came: and he filled them with the bread of heaven. He divided the rock, and waters flowed: rivers ran in the dry ground. Because he was mindful of his holy word, which he had uttered to Abraham his servant. And he brought forth his people in exultation, and his elect in joy. And he gave them the countries of the Nations: and they possessed the labours of peoples: That they might keep his justifications, and seek after his law.</div>
