			<div class='roleText'>WHOSOEVER believeth that JESUS is Christ, is born of God. And every one that loveth him which begat, loveth him also which was born of him. In this we know that we love the children of God: when as we love God, and keep his commandments. For this is the charity of God, that we keep his commandments: and his commandments are not heavy. Because all that is born of God, overcometh the world: And this is the victory which overcometh the world, our faith. Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth that JESUS is the Son of God? This is he that came by water &amp; blood^ JESUS Christ: not in water only, but in water and blood. And it is the Spirit which testifieth, that Christ is the truth. For there be three which give testimony in heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghost. And these three be one. And there be three which give testimony in earth: the spirit, water, and blood: and these three be one. If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater. Because this is the testimony of God which is greater, that he hath testified of his Son. He that believeth in the Son of God, hath the testimony of God in himself. He that believeth not the Son, maketh him a liar: because he believeth not in the testimony which God hath testified of his Son. And this is the testimony, that God hath given us life everlasting. And this life is in his Son. He that hath the Son, hath life. He that hath not the Son of God, hath not life. These things I write to you, that you may know that you have eternal life which believe in the name of the Son of God. And this is the confidence which we have toward him: that, whatsoever we shall ask according to his will, he heareth us. And we know that he heareth us whatsoever we shall ask: we know that we have the petitions which we request of him. He that knoweth his brother to sin a sin not to death, let him ask, and life shall be given him, sinning not to death. There is a sin to death: for that I say not that any man ask. All iniquity, is sin. And there is a sin to death. We know that every one which is born of God, sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him, and the wicked one toucheth him not. We know that we are of God, and the whole world is set in wickedness. And we know that the Son of God cometh: and he hath given us understanding, that we may know the true God, &amp; may be in his true Son, This is the true God, &amp; life everlasting. My little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.</div>
