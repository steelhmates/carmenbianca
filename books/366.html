			<div class='roleText'>David therefore called together all the Princes of Israel, the Dukes of the tribes, and the heads of the companies, which ministered to the king: the tribunes also and the centurions, and them that were chief over the substance and possessions of the king, and his sons with the eunuchs, and the mighty, and all the most valiant in the host of Jerusalem. And when the king had risen up, and stood, he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hear me my brethren, and my people: I meant to have built a house, wherein the Ark of our Lord might rest, and the foot stool of the feet of our God: and to build it I prepared all things. But God said to me: Thou shalt not build a house to my name: because thou art a man of war, and hast shed blood Howbeit our Lord the God of Israel chose me of all the house of my father, to be king over Israel for ever: for of Juda he chose the Princes: moreover of the house of Juda, my father's house: and of the sons of my father, it pleased him to choose me king over all Israel. Yea and of my sons (for our Lord hath given me many sons) he hath chosen Salomon my son, to sit in the throne of the Kingdom of our Lord over Israel, and he said to me: Salomon thy son shall build my house, and my courts: for him have I chosen to me for a son, and I will be to him for a father. And I will confirm his Kingdom for ever, if he shall persevere to do my precepts, and my judgments, as at this day. Now then before all the assembly of Israel in the hearing of our God, keep ye, and search all the commandments of our Lord God: that you may possess the good land, &amp; may leave it to your children after you for ever. And thou Salomon my son, know the God of thy father, and serve him with a perfect heart, and a voluntary mind: for our Lord searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all cogitations of minds. If thou seek him, thou shalt find: but if thou forsake him he will reject thee for ever. Now therefore because our Lord hath chosen thee to build the house of the Sanctuary, take courage, and perfit it. And David gave to Salomon his son a description of the porch, and of the temple and of the cellars, and of the upper loft, and of the chambers in the inner rooms, and of the house of the propitiation, moreover also of all the courts, which he had thought upon, and of the chambers round about, for the treasures of the house of our Lord, and for the treasures of the holy things, and of the divisions of the Priests and the Levites, for all the works of the house of our Lord, and for all the vessels of the ministry of the temple of our Lord. Gold in weight for every vessel of the ministry. A weight of silver also according to the diversity of the vessels and works. And for golden candlesticks also, and their lamps, gold according to the measure of every candlestick, and of the lamps. In like manner also for the silver candlesticks, and for their lamps, according to the diversity of the measure, he delivered a weight of silver. He gave also gold for tables of proposition, according to the diversity of the tables: in like manner also silver for other silver tables. For flesh-hooks also, and phials, and censers of most pure gold, and for little lions of gold, according to the quality of the measure he distributed a weight, for lion and lion. In like manner also for lions of silver he separated a diverse weight of silver. And for the Altar whereupon incense is burnt, he gave most pure gold: that of it might be made a similitude of the chariot of the Cherubs spreading their wings, and covering the Ark of the covenant of our Lord. All things, quoth he, came written with the hand of our Lord unto me: that I might understand all the works of the pattern. David also said to Salomon his son: Deal manfully, and take courage, and do it: fear not, and be not dismayed: for our Lord my God will be with thee, and will not leave thee, nor forsake thee, till thou perfit all the work of the ministry of the house of our Lord. Behold the divisions of the Priests and the Levites, for every ministry of the house of our Lord, assist thee, and are ready, and as well the Princes know, as the people, to do all thy precepts.</div>
