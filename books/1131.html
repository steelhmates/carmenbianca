			<div class='roleText'>AND there were certain present at that very time telling him of the Galilaeans, whose blood Pilate mingled with their sacrifices. And he answering said to them: Think you that these Galilaeans were sinners more than all the Galilaeans, that they suffered such things? No, I say to you: but unless you have penance, you shall all likewise perish. As those eighteen upon whom the tower fell in Siloe, and slew them: think you that they also were debters above all the men that dwell in Jerusalem? No, I say to you: but if you have not penance you shall all likewise perish. And he said this similitude: A certain man had a figtree planted in his vineyard, and he came seeking for fruit on it, and found not. And he said to the dresser of the vineyard, Lo it is three years since I come seeking for fruit upon this figtree, and I find not. Cut it down therefore; whereto doth it also occupy the ground? But he answering said to him: Lord, let it alone this year also, until I dig about it, and dung it. And if happily it yield fruit: but if not, hereafter thou shalt cut it down. And he was teaching in their Synagogue on the Sabboths. And behold a woman that had a spirit of infirmity eighteen years: and she was crooked, neither could she look upward at all. Whom when JESUS saw, he called her unto him, and said to her: Woman, thou art delivered from thy infirmity. And he imposed hands upon her, and forthwith she was made straight and glorified God. And the Archsynagogue answering (because he had indignation that JESUS had cured on the Sabboth) said to the multitude: Six days there are wherein you ought to work. In them therefore come, and be cured; and not in the Sabboth day. And our Lord answering to him, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hypocrite, doth not every one of you upon the Sabboth loose his ox or his ass from the manger, and leadeth them to water? But this daughter of Abraham whom Satan hath bound, lo, these eighteen years, ought not she to be loosed from this bond on the Sabboth day? And when he said these things, all his adversaries were ashamed: and all the people rejoiced in all things that were gloriously done of him. He said therefore: Whereunto is the Kingdom of God like, and whereunto shall I esteem it like? It is like to a mustard seed, which a man took and cast into his garden and it grew, and became a great tree, &amp; the fowls of the air rested in the boughs thereof. And again he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Like to what shall I esteem the Kingdom of God? It is like to leaven, which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. And he went by the cities and towns teaching, and making his journey unto Jerusalem. And a certain man said to him: Lord, be they few that are saved? But he said to them: Strive to enter by the narrow gate: because many, I say to you, shall seek to enter, and shall not be able. But when the good-man of the house shall enter in, and shut the door, and you shall begin to stand without, and knock at the door, saying, Lord open to us: and he answering shall say to you, I know you not whence you are: then you shall begin to say: We did eat before thee and drink, and in our streets didst thou teach. And he shall say to you, I know you not whence you are, depart from me all ye workers of iniquity. There shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth: when you shall see Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, and all the Prophets in the Kingdom of God, and you to be thrust out. And there shall come from the East and West &amp; the North and the South; and shall sit down in the Kingdom of God. And behold, they are last that shall be first, and they be first that shall be last. The same day there came certain of the Pharisees, saying to him: Depart and get thee hence, because Herod will kill thee. And he said to them: Go, and tell that fox, Behold I cast out devils, and perfit cures this day and tomorrow, and the third day I am consummate. But yet I must walk this day and tomorrow and the day following, because it cannot be that a Prophet perish out of Jerusalem. Jerusalem, Jerusalem which killest the Prophets, and stonest them that are sent to thee, how often would I gather thy children as the bird doth her brood under her wings, and thou wouldest not? Behold your house shall be left desert to you. And I say to you, that you shall not see me till it come when you shall say: Blessed is he that cometh in the name of our Lord.</div>
