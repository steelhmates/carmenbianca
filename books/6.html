			<div class='roleText'>My spirit shall not remain in man for ever, because he is flesh: and his days shall be an hundred and twenty years. And Giants were upon the earth in those days. For after the sons of God did company with the daughters of men, &amp; they brought forth children, these be the mighty of the old world, famous men. And God seeing the malice of men was much on the earth, &amp; that all the cogitation of their heart was bent to evil at all times, it repented him that he had made man on the earth. And touched inwardly with sorrow of heart, I will, saith he, clean take away man, whom I have created, from the face of the earth, from man even to beasts, from that which creepeth even unto the fowls of the air. For it repenteth me that I have made them. But Noe found grace before our Lord. These are the generations of Noe: Noe was a just and perfect man in his generations, he did walk with God. And he begat three sons, Sem, Cham, and Japheth. And the earth was corrupted before God, &amp; was replenished with iniquity. And when God had perceived that the earth was corrupted (for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth) He said to Noe: The end of all flesh is come before me, the earth is replenished with iniquity from the face of them, and I will destroy them with the earth. Make thee an ark of timber plank: cabinets shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with bitume. And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the Ark shall be three hundred cubits: fifty cubits the breadth, and thirty cubits the height of it. Thou shalt make a window in the ark, &amp; in a cubit finish the top of it: &amp; the door of the ark thou shalt set at the side below, middle chambers &amp; third lofts shalt thou make in it. Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, that I may destroy all flesh wherein there is breath of life under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed. And I will establish my covenant with thee: and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee. And of all living creatures of all flesh, thou shalt bring pairs into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex and the female. Of fowls according to their kind, and beasts in their kind, and of all that creepeth on the earth, according to their kind: pairs of all sorts shall enter in with thee, that they may live. Thou shalt take therefore with thee of all meats, that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay them up with thee: &amp; they shall be meat for thee and them. Noe therefore did all things which God commanded him.</div>
