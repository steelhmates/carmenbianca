Make thee an ark of timber plank: cabinets shalt thou make in the ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with bitume. And thus shalt thou make it. The length of the Ark shall be three hundred cubits: fifty cubits the breadth, and thirty cubits the height of it. Thou shalt make a window in the ark, &amp; in a cubit finish the top of it: &amp; the door of the ark thou shalt set at the side below, middle chambers &amp; third lofts shalt thou make in it. Behold I will bring the waters of a great flood upon the earth, that I may destroy all flesh wherein there is breath of life under heaven. All things that are in the earth shall be consumed. And I will establish my covenant with thee: and thou shalt enter into the ark, thou and thy sons, and thy wife, and the wives of thy sons with thee. And of all living creatures of all flesh, thou shalt bring pairs into the ark, that they may live with thee: of the male sex and the female. Of fowls according to their kind, and beasts in their kind, and of all that creepeth on the earth, according to their kind: pairs of all sorts shall enter in with thee, that they may live. Thou shalt take therefore with thee of all meats, that may be eaten, and thou shalt lay them up with thee: &amp; they shall be meat for thee and them. </div>
