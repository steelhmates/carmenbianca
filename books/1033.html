			<div class='roleText'>And the word of the Lord of hosts was made, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I have been jealous for Sion with great zeal, &amp; with great indignation have I been jealous for it. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: I am returned to Sion, &amp; I will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: &amp; Jerusalem shall be called the City of truth, &amp; the mount of the Lord of hosts, the sanctified mount. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: As yet shall old men dwell, &amp; old women in the streets of Jerusalem: &amp; every man's staff in his hand for multitude of years. And the streets of the city shall be filled with infants, &amp; girls playing in the streets thereof. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: If it shall seem hard in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days: Why, shall it be hard in mine eyes, saith the Lord of hosts? Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will save my people from the land of the East, and from the land of the going down of the sun. And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: &amp; they shall be my people, &amp; I will be their God in truth &amp; in justice. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Let your hands be strengthened, you that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the Prophets in the day, that the house of the Lord of hosts was founded, that the temple might be built. For before those days there was no hire for men, neither was there hire for beasts, neither was there peace to the comer in, nor goer out for tribulation: &amp; I did let go all men, every one against his neighbour. But now not according to the former days will I do to the remnant of this people, saith the Lord of hosts. But the seed of peace shall be: the vine shall give his fruit, and the earth shall give her spring, &amp; the heavens shall give their dew: &amp; I will make the remnant of this people to possess all these things. And it shall be: as you were a malediction among the Gentiles, o house of Juda, &amp; house of Israel: so will I save you, &amp; you shall be a benediction: fear not, let your hands be strengthened. Because thus saith the Lord of hosts: As I purposed to afflict you, when your fathers had provoked me to wrath saith our Lord, and I had no mercy: so converting I have meant in these days to do good to the house of Juda, and Jerusalem: fear not. These then are the words, which you shall do: Speak ye truth, every one with his neighbour: truth and judgement of peace judge ye in your gates. And think ye not every man in your heart evil against his friend: &amp; lying oath love ye not: for all these things are such as I hate, saith our Lord. And the word of our Lord of hosts was made to me saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The fast of the fourth, &amp; the fast of the fifth, &amp; the fast of the seventh, &amp; the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Juda into joy, and gladness, &amp; into goodly solemnities: truth only, and peace love ye. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, until peoples come, &amp; dwell in many cities, and the inhabitants go, one to another, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let us go, &amp; beseech the face of our Lord, &amp; let us seek the Lord of hosts: I also will go. And many peoples shall come, &amp; strong nations to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, &amp; to beseech the face of our Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: In those days, wherein ten men of all the tongue of the Gentiles shall take hold, &amp; they shall take hold of the skirt of a man that is a Jew, saying: </div>
