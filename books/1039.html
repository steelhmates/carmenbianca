			<div class='roleText'>Behold the days of our Lord shall come, and thy spoils shall be divided in the midst of thee. And I will gather together all nations to Jerusalem into battle, and the city shall be taken, and the houses shall be wasted, and the women shall be defiled: and the half part of the city shall go forth into captivity, and the rest of the people shall not be taken away out of the city. And our Lord will go forth, and will fight against those nations, as he fought in the day of conflict. And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of olives, which is against Jerusalem toward the East: and the mount of olives shall be cloven by the half part thereof to the East, and to the West with a steep rupture exceeding great, and half of the mountain shall be separated to the North, and half thereof to the South. And you shall fly to the valley of those mountains, because the valley of the mountains shall be joined even to the next, and you shall fly as you fled from the face of the earthquake in the days of Ozias king of Juda: and our Lord my God shall come, and all the saints with him. And it shall be in that day: there shall be no light, but cold and frost. And there shall be one day, which is known to our Lord, not day nor night: &amp; in the time of the evening there shall be light. And it shall be in that day: living waters shall issue forth out of Jerusalem: half of them to the East sea, and half of them to the last sea: in summer and in winter shall they be. And our Lord shall be King over all the earth: in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name shall be one. And all the land shall return even to the desert, from the hill of Remmon to the South of Jerusalem: and it shall be exalted, and shall dwell in her place, from the gate of Benjamin even to the place of the former gate, and even to the gate of the corners: and from the tower of Hananeel even to the king's presses. And they shall dwell in it, and there shall be anathema no more: but Jerusalem shall sit secure. And this shall be the plague, wherewith our Lord shall strike all nations, that have fought against Jerusalem: the flesh shall pine away of every one standing upon his feet, and his eyes shall wear away in their holes, and their tongue shall consume away in their mouth. In that day there shall be a great tumult of our Lord among them: and a man shall take the hand of his neighbour, &amp; his hand shall be clasped upon his neighbour's hand. Yea and Judas shall fight against Jerusalem: and the riches of all nations round about shall be gathered together, gold, and silver, and garments exceeding many. And so shall there be ruin of horse, and mule, and camel, and ass, and of all the beasts, that shall be in those tents, as is this ruin. And all that shall be left of all Nations, that came against Jerusalem, shall go up from year to year, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, and to celebrate the festivity of tabernacles. And it shall be: he that shall not ascend of the families of the land of Jerusalem, to adore the King, the Lord of hosts, there shall be no shower upon them. Yea and if the family of Aegypt shall not ascend, and shall not come: neither upon them shall it be, but ruin shall be, wherewith our Lord will strike all Nations that will not ascend to celebrate the festivity of tabernacles. This shall be the sin of Aegypt, and this the sin of all Nations, that will not ascend to celebrate the festivity of tabernacles. In that day shall that which is upon the bridle of the horse be holy to our Lord: and the cauldrons in the house of our Lord shall be as the phials before the altar. And every cauldron in Jerusalem, and Juda shall be sanctified to the Lord of hosts: &amp; all that immolate, shall come, and take of them, and shall seethe in them: and there shall be merchant no more in the house of the Lord of hosts in that day.</div>
