			<div class='roleText'>Come down, sit in the dust o Virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground: there is no throne for the daughter of the Chaldees, because thou shalt no more be called nice and tender. Take a mill, and grind meal: make bare thy turpitude, discover the shoulder, uncover the thighs, pass the rivers. Thine ignominy shall be discovered, and thy reproach shall be seen: I will take vengeance, and no man shall resist me. Our redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, the holy one of Israel. Sit holding thy peace, and enter into darkness, o daughter of the Chaldees: because thou shalt no more be called the lady of kingdoms. I was angry against my people, I have contaminated mine inheritance, and have given them into thy hand: thou hast not shewed mercies to them: upon the ancient thou hast made thy yoke exceeding heavy. And thou hast said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will be a lady for ever: thou hast not put these things upon thy heart, neither hast thou remembered thy later end. And now hear these things thou that art delicate, and dwellest confidently, that sayest in thy heart: I am, and there is none else beside me: I shall not sit a widow, and I shall not know barrenness. These two things shall come to thee suddenly in one day, barrenness and widowhood. All things are come upon thee, because of the multitude of thy sorceries, and for the vehement hardness of thine enchanters. And thou hast confidence in thy malice, and hast said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>There is none that seeth me. Thy wisdom, and thy knowledge, this hath deceived thee. And thou hast said in thy heart: I am, and beside me there is none other. Evil shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not know the rising thereof: and calamity shall fall violently upon thee, which thou canst not expiate: misery shall come upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know. Stand with thine enchanters, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, in which thou hast travailed from thy youth, if perhaps it may profit thee any thing, or if thou mayst become stronger. Thou hast failed in the multitude of thy counsels: let the astrologers of the heaven stand and save thee, which did contemplate the stars, and count the months, that by them they might tell things that shall come to thee. Behold they are become as stubble, fire hath burnt them, they shall not deliver their soul from the hand of the flame: there are no coals, wherewith they may be warmed, nor fire, that they may sit thereat. So are the things become unto thee, in whatsoever thou hast travailed: thy merchants from thy youth, every one hath erred in his own way, there is none that can save thee.</div>
