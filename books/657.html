			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of David, against Goliath. Blessed be our Lord my God, who teacheth my hands to battle, and my fingers to war. My mercy, and my refuge: my defender, and my deliverer. My protector; and I have hoped in him, who subdueth my people under me. Lord what is man, that thou art made known to him? Or the son of man, that thou esteemest him? Man is made like to vanity: his days pass as a shadow. Lord incline thy heavens, and descend: touch the mountains, and they will smoke. Lighten lightning, and thou shalt disperse them: shoot out thine arrows, and thou shalt destroy them. Send forth thy hand from on high, take me out, and deliver me from many waters: from the hand of children strangers. Whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity. O God I will sing to thee a new song: in the psalter of ten strings, I will sing to thee. Who givest salvation to kings: who hast redeemed David thy servant from the malignant sword: deliver me. And rescue me out of the hand of children strangers, whose mouth hath spoken vanity: and their right hand, is the right hand of iniquity. Whose sons, are as new plants in their youth. Their daughters comely trimmed: decked about after the similitude of a temple. Their store-houses full, flowing out of this into that. Their ewes full of young, abounding in their going forth: their oxen are fat. There is no ruin of wall, nor passage, nor cry in their streets. They have said, that it is a happy people, which hath these things: blessed is the people, whose God is our Lord.</div>
