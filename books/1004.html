			<div class='roleText'>And the word of our Lord was made to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying: Arise, and go into Ninive the great city, and preach in it: because the malice thereof is ascended before me. And Jonas arose to fly into Tharsis from the face of our Lord, and he went down into Joppe, and found a ship going into Tharsis: and he gave the fare thereof, and went down into it, that he might go with them into Tharsis from the face of our Lord. But our Lord sent a great wind into the sea: and a great tempest was made in the sea, and the ship was in danger to be broken.

			<div class='roleText'>We beseech thee o Lord, let us not perish in the life of this man, and give not upon us innocent blood: because thou o Lord, hast done as thou wouldest.
