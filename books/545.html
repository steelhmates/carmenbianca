Blessed is the man, to whom our Lord hath not imputed sin, neither is there guile in his spirit. Because I held my peace, my bones are inveterated, whilst I cried all the day. Because day &amp; night thy hand is made heavy upon me: I am turned in my anguish, whilst the thorn is fastened. I have made my sin known to thee: and my injustice I have not hid. I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will confess against me my injustice to our Lord: and thou hast forgiven the impiety of my sin. For this shall every holy one pray to thee, in time convenient. But yet in the flood of many waters, they shall not approach to him. Thou art my refuge from tribulation, which hath compassed me: my exultation, deliver me from them that compass me. I will give thee understanding, and will instruct thee in the way, that thou shalt go: I will fasten mine eyes upon thee. Do not become as horse and mule, which have no understanding. In bit and bridle bind fast their cheeks that approach not to thee. Many are the scourges of a sinner, but him that hopeth in our Lord mercy shall compass. Be joyful in our Lord and rejoice ye just, and glory all ye right of heart.</div>
