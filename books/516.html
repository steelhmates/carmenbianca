			<div class='roleText'>Why did the Gentiles rage, and peoples meditate vain things? The kings of the earth stood up, and the Princes came together in one against our Lord, and against his Christ. Let us break their bonds a-sunder: and let us cast away their yoke from us. He that dwelleth in the heavens shall laugh at them: and our Lord shall scorn them. Then shall he speak to them in his wrath, &amp; in his fury he shall trouble them. But I am appointed king by him over Sion his holy hill, preaching his precept. The Lord said to me: Thou art my Son, I this day have begotten thee. Ask of me, and I will give thee the Gentiles, for thine inheritance, and thy possession the ends of the earth. Thou shalt rule them in a rod of iron, and as a potter's vessel thou shalt break them in pieces. And now ye kings understand: take instruction you that judge the earth. Serve our Lord in fear: and rejoice to him with trembling. Apprehend discipline lest sometime our Lord be wrath, and you perish out of the just way. when his wrath shall burn in short time, blessed are all that trust in him.</div>
