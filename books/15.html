			<div class='roleText'>Lord God, what wilt thou give me? I shall go without children: and the son of the steward of my house is this Damascus Eliezer. And Abram added: But to me thou hast not given seed: and Lo my servant born in my house shall be mine heir. And immediately the word of our Lord came to him saying: </div>

And he brought him forth abroad, and said to him: Look up to heaven, and number the stars, if thou canst. And he said to him: so shall thy seed be.
