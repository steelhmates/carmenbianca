			<div class='roleText'>Blessed is the man that hath not offended in a word out of his mouth, and is not pricked with the sorrow of sin. Happy is he, that hath not had heaviness of his mind, and hath not fallen from his hope. Substance is without reason to the covetous man and niggard, and for the spiteful envious man to what purpose is gold? He that heapeth together from his heart unjustly, gathereth for others, and in his goods another will keep riot. He that is wicked to himself, to what other man will he be good? And he shall have no pleasure in his goods. He that envieth himself, nothing is worse than he, and this is the reward of his malice: and if he do good, he doth it ignorantly, and not willing: and at the last he manifesteth his malice. The eye of the envious is wicked, and turneth away his face, and despiseth his own soul. The eye of the covetous man insatiable in a portion of iniquity, will not be satisfied till he consume his own soul withering it. An evil eye is towards evil things: &amp; he shall have his fill of bread, needy &amp; in heaviness shall he be at his table. Son if thou have it, do good to thyself, and offer to God worthy oblations. Be mindful that death slacked not, and that the covenant of hell hath been shewed thee: for the covenant of this world shall die the death. Before death do good to thy friend, and according to thine ability stretching out thy hand, give to the poor. Be not defrauded of thy good day, and let not a little portion of a good gift over-pass thee. Shalt thou not leave to others thy sorrows, &amp; labours in the division of the lot? Give and take, and justify thy soul. Before thy death work justice: for in hell there cannot meat be found. All flesh shall wax old as grass, and as the leaf fructifying on a green tree. Some grow, and some are shaken off: so the generation of flesh and blood, one is ended, and another is born. All corruptible work shall fail in the end: and he that worketh it shall go therewith. And every excellent work shall be justified: and he that worketh it, shall be honoured therein. Blessed is the man that shall continue in wisdom, and that shall meditate in his justice, and in understanding shall consider the providence of God. He that considereth her ways in his heart, and hath understanding in her secrets, going after her as a searcher, and consisting in her ways: He that looketh through her windows, and heareth in her gates: He that resteth by her house, &amp; in her walls fastening a stake will set up his cottage beside her hands: and good things shall rest in his cottage for ever. He shall set his children under her covering, and shall abide under her boughs: he shall be protected under her covering from the heat, and shall rest in her glory.</div>
