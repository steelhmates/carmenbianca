			<div class='roleText'>O Death how bitter is thy memory to a man that hath peace in his riches: to a man that is at rest, and whose ways are prosperous in all things, and that is yet able to take meat! O death, thy judgement is good to a needy man, and him that is diminished in strength, and faileth in age, and that is careful of all things, and to the incredulous, that loseth patience! Fear not the judgement of death. Remember what things have been before thee, and what come after thee: this is the judgement from our Lord to all flesh: and what shall come upon thee by the good pleasure of the Highest? Whether it be ten, or an hundred, or a thousand years. For in hell there is no accusing of life. The children of sinners become children of abominations, and they that converse near the houses of the impious. The inheritance of the children of sinners shall perish, and with their seed shall be continuance of reproach. The children complain of an impious father, because for him they are in reproach. Woe to you ye impious men, which have forsaken the law of our Lord the Highest. And if ye be born, ye shall be born in malediction: and if ye die, in malediction shall be your portion. All things that are of the earth, shall return into the earth: so the impious from malediction to perdition. The mourning of men is in their body, but the name of the impious shall be clean wiped out. Have care of a good name: for this shall be more permanent to thee than a thousand treasures precious and great. There is a number of the days of a good life: but a good name shall continue for ever. Children, keep ye discipline in peace. For wisdom hid, and treasure not seen, what profit is there in them both? Better is the man that hideth his folly, than the man that hideth his wisdom. But yet have reverence to these things, which proceed from my mouth. For it is not good to observe all shamefastness: &amp; all things do not please all men in opinion. Be ashamed before father &amp; before mother, of fornication: and before the president and before the mighty, of lying: before the Prince, and before the judge, of offence: before the synagogue and the people, of iniquity: before companion and friend, of injustice: and before the place where thou dwellest, of theft, of the truth of God, and his testament: of leaning on the bread, and of reproof for the thing given and taken: before them that salute thee, of silence: of beholding a woman that is an harlot: and of turning away thy countenance from thy kinsman. Turn not away thy face from thy neighbour, &amp; of taking away part &amp; not restoring. Behold not another man's wife, and search not his handmaid, neither stand by her bed. Before friends, of opprobrious words: and when thou hast given, upbraid not.</div>
