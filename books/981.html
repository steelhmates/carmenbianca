			<div class='roleText'>Hear ye this o Priests, and attend ye house of Israel, and you the king's house harken: because there is judgement for you, because you are become a snare to speculation, &amp; a net spread upon Thabor. And victims you have declined into the depth: &amp; I^ the teacher of them all. I know Ephraim, &amp; Israel is not hid from me: because now hath Ephraim fornicated, Israel is contaminated. They will not give their cogitations to return to their God, because the spirit of fornications is in the midst of them, &amp; they have not known the Lord. And the arrogancy of Israel shall answer in his face: and Israel and Ephraim shall fall in their iniquity, Judas also shall fall with them. In their flocks and in their herds they shall go to seek the Lord, and shall not find: he is taken away from them. They have prevaricated against the Lord, because they have begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with their parts. Sound with the trumpet in Gabaa, &amp; with the shalm in Rama: howl ye in Bethaven, behind thy back o Benjamin. Ephraim shall be in desolation in the day of correction: in the tribes of Israel I have shewed faith. The princes of Juda are become as they that take the bound: I will pour out my wrath as water upon them. Ephraim is suffering calumny, broken in judgement: because he began to go after filthiness. And I as it were a moth to Ephraim: &amp; as the rot to the house of Juda. And Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judas his band: and Ephraim went to Assur, and sent to the king revenger: and he shall not be able to heal you, neither shall he be able to loose the band from you. Because I as it were a lioness to Ephraim, and as a lion's whelp to the house of Juda: I, I will take, and go: I will take away, and there is none that can deliver. Going I will return to my place: until you fail and seek my face.</div>
