			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan, the son of Ozias king of Juda, there came up Rasin the king of Syria, and Phacee the son of Romelia the king of Israel, to Jerusalem to fight against it: and they could not overcome it. And they told the house of David, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Syria hath rested upon Ephraim, and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved at the face of the wind. And our Lord said to Isaie: Go forth to meet Achaz, thou, and Jasub thy son that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool, in the way of the Fuller's field. And thou shalt say to him: See thou be still: fear not, and let not thine heart be afraid of the two tails of these smoking firebrands, in the wrath of the fury of Rasin the king of Syria, and of the son of Romelia. For that Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim, and the son of Romelia, saying: Let us go up to Juda, and raise it up, and pluck it away to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof. Thus saith our Lord God: It shall not stand, &amp; this shall not be. But the head of Syria Damascus, &amp; the head of Damascus, Rasin: and yet threescore and five years, and Ephraim shall cease to be a people: And the head of Ephraim Samaria, and the head of Samaria the son of Romelia. If you will not believe, you shall not be permanent. And our Lord added to speak to Achaz, saying. Ask a sign for thee of the Lord thy God unto the depth of hell, or unto the height above. And Achaz said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hear ye therefore o house of David: Is it a small thing for you, to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also? Therefore shall our Lord himself give you a sign. Behold a Virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, &amp; his name shall be called Emmanuel. He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse evil, and choose the good. For before the child know to refuse evil, and choose good, the land which thou doest detest shall be forsaken of the face of her two kings. Our Lord will bring upon thee, &amp; upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days that came not since the days of the separation of Ephraim from Juda, with the king of the Assyrians. And it shall be in that day: our Lord shall hiss to the fly, that is in the uttermost part of the rivers of Aegypt, and to the bee, that is in the land of Assur. And they shall come, and shall rest all in the torrents of valleys, and in the caves of rocks, and in all shrub places, and in all holes. In that day our Lord shall shave with a razor, hired by them, that are beyond the river, by the king of the Assyrians, the head, and the hairs of the feet, and the whole beard. And it shall be in that day: a man shall nourish a young cow, and two ewes. And for the aboundance of milk he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat, that shall be left in the midst of the land. And it shall be in that day: every place where there shall be a thousand vines, for a thousand pieces of silver, they shall be into thorns and briers. With arrows &amp; bow they shall go in thither: for briers and thorns shall be in all the land. And all mountains, that shall be weeded with a weeding hook, the terror of thorns and briers shall not come thither, and it shall be for the oxe to feed on, and cattle to tread upon.</div>
