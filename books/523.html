			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for the secrets of the son, the Psalm of David. I will confess to thee, o Lord, with all my heart: I will tell all thy marvelous things. I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing to thy name, o most High. In turning mine enemy backward: they shall be weakened, and perish before my face. Because thou hast done my judgment and my cause: thou hast sit upon the throne which judgest justice. Thou hast rebuked the Gentiles, and the impious hath perished: their name thou hast destroyed for ever, and for ever and ever. The swords of the enemy have failed unto the end: and their cities thou hast destroyed. Their memory hath perished with a sound: and our Lord abideth for ever. He hath prepared his throne in judgment: and he will judge the whole world in equity, he will judge the people in justice. And our Lord is made a refuge for the poor: an helper in opportunities, in tribulation. And let them hope in thee that know thy name: because thou hast not forsaken them that seek thee, o Lord. Sing to our Lord, which dwelleth in Sion: declare his studies among the Gentiles. Because requiring blood he hath remembered them: he hath not forgotten the cry of the poor. Have mercy on me, o Lord: See my humiliation by my enemies. Which exaltest me from the gates of death, that I may declare all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of Sion. I will rejoice in thy salvation: the Gentiles are fastened in the destruction, which they made. In this snare, which they hid, is their foot taken. Our Lord shall be known doing judgments: the sinner is taken in the works of his own hands. Let sinners be turned into hell, all nations that forget God. Because to the end there shall not be oblivion of the poor man: the patience of the poor, shall not perish in the end. Arise Lord, let not man be strengthened: Let the Gentiles be judged in thy sight. Appoint Lord a Law-giver over them: that the Gentiles may know that they be men. Why Lord hast thou departed far off, despisest in opportunities, in tribulation? Whilst the impious is proud, the poor is set on fire: they are caught in the counsels which they devise. Because the sinner is praised in the desires of his soul: and the unjust man is blessed. The sinner hath exasperated our Lord, according to the multitude of his wrath he shall not seek. There is no God in his sight: his ways are defiled at all time. Thy judgments are taken away from his face: he shall rule over all his enemies. For he hath said in his heart: I will not be moved from generation unto generation without evil. Whose mouth is full of cursing, and bitterness, and guile: under his tongue labour and sorrow. He sitteth in wait with the rich in secret places, to kill the innocent. His eyes look upon the poor: he lieth in wait in secret, as a lion in his den. He lieth in wait to take the poor man violently, violently to take the poor man whilst he draweth him. In his snare he will humble himself, and shall fall when he shall have dominion over the poor. For he hath said in his heart: God hath forgotten, he hath turned away his face not to see for ever. Arise Lord God, let thy hand be exalted: forget not the poor. Wherefore hath the impious provoked God? For he hath said in his heart: He will not inquire. Thou seest, that thou considerest labour &amp; sorrow: that thou mayest deliver them into thy hands. To thee is the poor left: to the orphan thou wilt be an helper. Break the arm of the sinner and malignant: his sin shall be sought, and shall not be found. Our Lord shall reign for ever, and for ever and ever: ye Gentiles shall perish from his land. Our Lord hath heard the desire of the poor: thy ear hath heard the preparation of their heart. To judge for the pupil and the humble, that man add no more to magnify himself upon the earth.</div>
