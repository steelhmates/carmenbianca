This Booz, to whose maids thou art joined in the field, is our nigh kinsman, and this night he winnoweth the barn floor of the barley. Wash therefore and anoint thyself, and put on thy better garments, and go down into the barn floor, let no man see thee, till he shall have ended eating &amp; drinking. And when he shall go to sleep, mark the place wherein he sleepeth: and thou shalt come, and discover the mantle wherewith he is covered toward his feet, and shall cast thyself down and lie there: and he will tell thee what thou must do.

Neither do I deny myself nigh of kin, but there is another nearer than I. Rest this night: and when morning is come, if he will retain thee by the right of nigh of kindred, the thing is well done, but if he will not, I will take thee without all doubt, our Lord liveth, sleep until morning. She slept therefore at his feet till the night was gone. Therefore she arose before men could know one another, and Booz said: </div>
