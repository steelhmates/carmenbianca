			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end for presses, the Psalm of David. O Lord our Lord, how marvelous is thy name in the whole earth! Because thy magnificence is elevated above the heavens. Out of the mouth of infants &amp; sucklings, thou hast perfected praise because of thine enemies, that thou mayest destroy the enemy &amp; revenger. Because I shall see thy heavens, the works of thy fingers: the moon and the stars, which thou hast founded. What is man, that thou art mindful of him? Or the son of man, that thou visitest him? Thou hast minished him a little less than Angels; with glory and honour thou hast crowned him: And hast appointed him over the works of thy hands. Thou hast subjected all things under his feet, all sheep and oxen: moreover also the beasts of the field. The birds of the air, &amp; fishes of the sea; that walk the paths of the sea. O Lord our Lord, how marvelous is thy name in the whole earth!</div>
