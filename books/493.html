			<div class='roleText'>But Job answering, said: Hear I beseech you my words, and do penance. Bear with me, that I also may speak, and after my words, if it shall seem good, laugh ye. Is my disputation against man, that I ought not worthily to be sorry? Harken to me, and be astonished, and put the finger upon your mouth. And I^ when I shall remember, am afraid, and trembling shaketh my flesh. Why then do the impious live, are they advanced, &amp; strengthened with riches? Their seed continueth before them, a multitude of kinsmen, &amp; of nephews in their sight. Their houses be secure &amp; peaceable, &amp; the rod of God is not upon them. Their bullock hath conceived, &amp; hath not made abortion: their cow hath calved, and is not deprived of her calf. Their little ones go forth as flocks, and their infants rejoice with pastimes. They hold the timbrel, &amp; the harp, &amp; rejoice at the sound of the organ. They lead their days in wealth, and in a moment they go down to hell. Who said to God: depart from us, we will not the knowledge of thy ways. Who is the Omnipotent, that we should serve him? And what doth it profit us if we shall pray him? But yet because their good things are not in their hand, be the counsel of the impious far from me. How often shall the candle of the impious be extinguished, and inundation come upon them, and shall he divide the sorrows of his fury? They shall be as chaff before the face of the wind, and as ashes, which the whirlwind scattereth. God shall reserve the sorrow of the father to his children: and when he shall have rendered it, then shall he know. His eyes shall see his own slaughter, and he shall drink the fury of the Omnipotent. For what doeth it pertain to him concerning his house after him: although the number of his months be diminished the half? Shall any man teach God knowledge, who judgeth the high ones? This man dieth strong and in health, rich and happy. His bowels be full of fat, and his bones be embrued with marrow. But another dieth in bitterness of soul without any riches: And yet they shall sleep together in the dust, and worms shall cover them. Surely I know your cogitations, &amp; unjust sentences against me. For you say: Where is the house of the Prince? &amp; where are the tabernacles of the impious? Ask any of the wayfaring men, &amp; you shall understand that he knoweth these self-same things. Because the evil man is kept unto the day of perdition, and he shall be led to the day of fury. Who shall reprove his way before him? And who shall repay him the things that he hath done? He shall be brought to the graves, and shall watch in the head of the dead. He hath been sweet to the gravel of Cocytus, and after him he shall draw every man, and before him innumerable. How therefore do ye comfort me in vain, whereas your answer is shewed to be repugnant to the truth?</div>
