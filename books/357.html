			<div class='roleText'>I will do mercy with Hanon the son of Naas: for his father hath done me pleasure. And David sent messengers to comfort him upon the death of his father. Who when they were come into the land of the children of Ammon, to comfort Hanon, the Princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanon: Thou thinkest perhaps, that David for honour sake toward thy father hath sent some that should comfort thee; neither markest thou, that his servants are come to thee to espy, and seek out, and search thy land. Therefore Hanon made the servants of David bald, and shaved them, and cut away their coats from the buttocks to the feet, and sent them away. Who when they were gone, and had sent word to David, he sent to meet them (for they had sustained great reproach) and commanded them to tarry in Jericho, till their beard grew, and then they should return. And the children of Ammon seeing, that they had done injury to David, as well Hanon as the rest of the people, they sent a thousand talents of silver, to hire them chariots and horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and from Syria Maacha, and from Soba. And they hired two and thirty thousand chariots, &amp; king Maacha with his people. Who when they were come, camped over against Medaba. The children of Ammon also being gathered together out of their cities, came to the battle. Which when David had heard, he sent Joab, and all the host of valiant men: and the children of Ammon issuing forth, put their army in array beside the gate of the city: and the kings, that were come to aid him, stood apart in the field. Joab therefore understanding that battle was made against him before and behind, chose the most valiant men of all Israel, and marched on against the Syrian. And the rest of the people he gave under the hand of Abisai his brother: and they went forth against the children of Ammon. And he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>If the Syrian shall overcome me, thou shalt aid me: and if the children of Ammon shall overcome thee, I will aid thee. Take courage, and let us play the men for our people, and for the cities of our God: and our Lord will do that which is good in his sight. Joab therefore marched on, and the people that were with him, against the Syrian to battle: and he put them to flight. Moreover the children of Ammon seeing that the Syrian was fled, themselves also fled from Abisai his brother, and went into the city: and Joab also returned into Jerusalem. But the Syrian seeing that he was fallen before Israel, sent messengers, and brought the Syrian, that was beyond the river: and Sophach the General of Adarezer's war, was their captain. Which when it was told David, he gathered together all Israel, and passed Jordan, and fell upon them, &amp; directed his army against him, they fighting on the contrary part. And the Syrian fled from Israel: and David slew of the Syrians seven thousand chariots, and forty thousand footmen, and Sophach General of the army. And the servants of Adarezer seeing themselves to be overcome of Israel, fled to David, and served him: and Syria would no more give aid to the children of Ammon.</div>
