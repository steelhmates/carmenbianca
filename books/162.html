			<div class='roleText'>Hear Israel: Thou shalt go over Jordan this day to possess very great nations and stronger than thyself, huge cities, and walled even unto heaven, a great people and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom thou hast seen, and heard, against whom no man is able to resist. Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God himself will pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire, who shall destroy and abolish and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly, as he hath spoken to thee. Say not in thy heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my justice hath our Lord brought me in to possess this land, whereas these nations were destroyed for their impieties. For not because of thy justices and equity of thy heart dost thou enter in to possess their lands: but because they have done impiously, at thy entering in they are destroyed: and that our Lord might accomplish his word, which by oath he promised to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Know therefore that not for thy justices hath the Lord thy God given thee this excellent land in possession, whereas thou art a very stiff necked people. Remember, and forget not how thou didst provoke the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness. From the same day that thou camest out of Aegypt, unto this place, thou hast always contended against our Lord. For in Horeb also thou didst provoke him, and being wrath he would have destroyed thee, when I went up into the mount, to receive the tables of stone, of the covenant which our Lord made with you: and I continued in the mount forty days and nights, not eating bread, nor drinking water. And our Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and containing all the words that he spake to you in the mount from the midst of the fire, when the assembly of the people was gathered. And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, our Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of covenant, and he said to me: Arise, and go down from hence quickly: for thy people which thou didst bring out of Aegypt, have quickly forsaken the way, that thou hast shewed them, and have made them a molten idol. And again our Lord said to me: I see that this people is stiff necked: suffer me that I may destroy them, and abolish their name from under heaven, and may set thee over a Nation, that is greater and stronger than this. And when I came down from the burning mount, and held the two tables of covenant with both hands, and saw that you had sinned to the Lord your God, and had made you a molten calf, and had quickly forsaken his way which he had shewed you, I cast the tables out of my hands, and brake them in your sight. And I fell down before our Lord as before, forty days and nights not eating bread, nor drinking water, for all your sins, which you committed against our Lord, and provoked him to wrath: for I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being moved against you, he would have destroyed you. And our Lord heard me this time also. Against Aaron also being exceeding angry, he would have destroyed him, and for him in like manner did I pray. And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took, and burnt it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, and bringing it wholly into dust, I threw it into the torrent that descendeth from the mount. In the burning also and in the tentation, and in the Sepulchres of concupiscence you provoked our Lord: and when he sent you from Cadesbarne, saying: Go up, and possess the Land that I have given you, and you contemned the commandment of your Lord God, and did not believe him, neither would you hear his voice, but were always rebellious from the day that I began to know you. And I lay before our Lord forty days and nights, in the which I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy you as he had threatened: and praying I said: Lord God, destroy not thy people, and thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness, whom thou didst bring out of Aegypt in a strong hand. Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: regard not the stubbornness of this people, and his impiety and sin: lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which thou hast brought us, say: The Lord could not bring them in unto the Land, that he promised them, and he hated them: therefore did he bring them forth, that he might kill them in the wilderness. Which are thy people and thine inheritance, whom thou didst bring forth in thy great strength, and in thy stretched out arm.</div>
