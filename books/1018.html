			<div class='roleText'>The burden that Habacuc the Prophet saw. How long o Lord shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear? Shall I cry out to thee suffering violence, and thou wilt not save? Why hast thou shewed me iniquity and labour, to see prey and injustice against me? And judgement is made, and contradiction more mighty. For this cause is the law torn, and judgement came not to the end: because the impious prevaileth against the just, therefore doth there come forth perverse judgement. Behold ye in the nations, and see: marvel, and be astonished: because a work is done in your days, which no man will believe when it shall be told. Because lo I will raise up the Chaldees, a bitter and swift nation, walking upon the latitude of the earth, to possess tabernacles not their own. It is horrible, &amp; terrible: out of itself shall the judgement, &amp; the burden thereof proceed. His horses lighter than leopards, and swifter than evening wolves; and his horsemen shall be spread abroad, for his horsemen shall come from a far, they shall fly as an eagle hastening to eat. All shall come to the prey, their faces a burning wind: and he shall gather together as the sand, captivity. And he shall triumph over kings, and tyrants shall be his laughing stock, and he shall laugh upon every munition, and shall cast up a mount, and shall take it. Then shall the spirit be changed, and he shall pass, and fall: this is his strength of his god. Why wast thou not from the beginning o Lord my God, my holy one, &amp; we shall not die? Lord thou hast appointed him for judgement: and strong to chastise, thou hast founded him. Thine eyes are clean, from seeing evil, and thou canst not look toward iniquity. Why lookest thou not upon them that do unjust things, and holdest thy peace when the impious devoureth him that is more just than himself? And thou wilt make them as the fishes of the sea, and as the creeping beast not having a prince. He lifted up all in the hook, he drew it in his train, and gathered it into his net: upon this he will be glad and rejoice. Therefore will he immolate to his train, and he will sacrifice to his net: because by them his portion is fat, &amp; his meat chosen. For this cause therefore spreadeth he his train, and always to kill the nations he will not spare.</div>
