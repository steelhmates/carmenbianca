			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of Canticle, in the dedication of David's house. I will exalt thee, o Lord because thou hast received me: neither hast delighted mine enemies over me. O Lord my God I have cried to thee, and thou hast healed me. Lord thou hast brought forth my soul out of hell: thou hast saved me from them that go down into the lake. Sing to our Lord ye his Saints: and confess to the memory of his holiness. Because wrath is in his indignation: and life in his will. At evening shall weeping abide: and in the morning gladness. And I said in my aboundance: I will not be moved for ever. O Lord in thy will thou hast given strength to my beauty. Thou hast turned away thy face from me, and I became troubled. To thee o Lord I will cry: and I will pray to my God. What profit is in my blood, whilst I descend into corruption? Shall dust confess to thee, or declare thy truth? Our Lord hath heard, and had mercy on me: our Lord is become my helper. Thou hast turned my mourning into joy unto me: thou hast cut my sackcloth, and hast compassed me with gladness. That my glory may sing to thee, and I be not compunct: Lord my God for ever will I confess to thee.</div>
