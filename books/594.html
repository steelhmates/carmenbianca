			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for wine presses, a Psalm to Asaph himself. Rejoice to God our helper: make Jubilation to the God of Jacob. Take ye Psalm, and give timbrel: pleasant Psalter with the harp. Sound ye with trumpet in the new moon, in the notable day of your solemnity. Because it is a precept in Israel, and judgment to the God of Jacob. He put it for a testimony in Joseph, when he came out of the Land of Aegypt: he heard a tongue which he knew not. He turned away his back from burdens: his hands served in baskets. In tribulation thou didst invocate me, and I heard thee: I heard thee in the secret of the tempest: I proved thee at the water of contradiction. Hear, o my people, and I will contest thee: Israel if thou wilt hear me. There shall be no new god in thee, neither shalt thou adore a strange god. For I am the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Aegypt: dilate thy mouth and I will fill it. And my People heard not my voice: and Israel attended not to me. And I let them alone, according to the desires of their heart, they shall go in their own inventions. If my people had heard me, if Israel had walked in my ways: I had for nothing perhaps humbled their enemies: and had laid my hand upon those that afflict them. The enemies of our Lord have lied to him: and their time shall be for ever. And he fed them of the fat of corn: and out of the rock with honey he filled them.</div>
