			<div class='roleText'>Be not glad Israel, rejoice not as the peoples: because thou hast fornicated from thy God, thou hast loved reward above all the floors of wheat. The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the wine shall lie to them. They shall not dwell in the land of our Lord: Ephraim is returned into Aegypt, and among the Assyrians he hath eaten the thing polluted. They shall not offer wine to our Lord, and they shall not please him: their sacrifices as the bread of mourners: all that shall eat it shall be contaminated: because their bread for their soul, shall not enter into the house of our Lord. What will you do in the solemn day, in the day of the festivity of our Lord? For behold they are gone forth from destruction: Aegypt shall gather them together, Memphis shall bury them: their silver to be desired the nettle shall inherit, the bur in their tabernacles. The days of visitation are come, the days are come of retributions: know o Israel the foolish Prophet, the mad spiritual man, for the multitude of thine iniquity, the multitude also madness. The watchman of Ephraim with my God: the Prophet is made a snare of ruin upon all his ways, madness in the house of his God. They have sinned deeply, as in the days of Gabaa: he will remember their iniquity, and will visit their sin. As grapes in the desert I found Israel: as the first fruits of the fig-tree in the top thereof I saw their fathers: but they have entered into Beelphegor, and are alienated into confusion, and are become abominable, as those things, which they loved. Ephraim as a bird hath flown away, their glory from birth, and from the womb, and from conception. But if they shall nourish up their children, I will make them without children among men: yea and woe to them, when I shall depart from them. Ephraim, as I saw, was Tyre founded in beauty: &amp; Ephraim shall lead out his children to the murderer. Give them o Lord, what wilt thou give to them? Give them a womb without children, &amp; dry breasts. All their wicked in Galgal, because there I hated them: for the malice of their inventions I will cast them forth out of my house: I will not add to love them, all their princes revolters. Ephraim is strucken, their root is dried up, they shall yield no fruit. But and if they shall have issue, I will kill the best beloved things of their womb. My God will cast them away, because they hear him not: and they shall be vagabonds in the nations.</div>
