And I saw a strong Angel, preaching with a loud voice: Who is worthy to open the book, &amp; to loose the seals thereof? And no man was able neither in heaven nor in earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, nor look on it. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open the book, nor to see it. And one of the Seniors said to me: Weep not; behold the Lion of the Tribe of Juda, the root of David, hath won, to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

And I looked, and heard the voice of many Angels round about the throne, and of the beasts &amp; of the Seniors: and the number of them was thousands of thousands, saying with a loud voice: The Lamb that was slain, is worthy to receive power, and divinity, and wisdom, and strength, and honour, and glory, and benediction. And every creature that is in heaven, and upon the earth, and under the earth, and that are in the sea, and that are therein: all did I hear saying: </div>
