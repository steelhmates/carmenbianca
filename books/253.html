			<div class='roleText'>And the Philisthiims gathering together their companies unto battle, assembled into Socho of Juda: and camped between Socho and Azeca in the borders of Dommim. Moreover Saul and the children of Israel being gathered together came into the valley of Terebinth, and they put the army in array to fight against the Philisthiims. And the Philisthiims stood upon the mountain on this side, and Israel stood upon the mountain on the other side: and the valley was between them. And there came forth a man that was a bastard from the camp of the Philistians, named Goliath, of Geth, in height six cubits and a palm: and a helmet of brass upon his head, &amp; he was clothed with a coat of mail linked. Moreover the weight of his coat of mail was five thousand sicles of brass: and he had brazen boots on his thighs, and a target of brass covered his shoulders. And the shaft of his spear was as it were a weaver's beam, and the very iron of his spear had six hundred sicles of iron: and his esquire went before him. And standing he cried against the bands of Israel, &amp; said to them: Why came you prepared to fight? Am not I a Philistian, and you the servants of Saul? Choose out a man of you, and let him descend to fight hand to hand. If he shall be able to fight with me, &amp; strike me, we will be servants to you: but if I shall prevail, &amp; shall beat him, you shall be servants, &amp; shall serve us. And the Philistian said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I have defied the bands of Israel this day: Give me a man, and let him fight with me hand to hand. And Saul and all the Israelites hearing such words of the Philistians, were astonished, and feared exceedingly. And there was David the son of a man that was an Ephratheite, of whom there was mention before, of Bethlehem Juda, whose name was Isai, who had eight sons, and he was in the days of Saul an old man, and aged among men. And his three elder sons went after Saul into battle: and the names of his three sons, which went to battle, were Eliab the first begotten, and the second Abinadab, the third also Samma: and David was the youngest. The three elder therefore having followed Saul, David went, and returned from Saul, to feed his father's flock in Bethlehem. But the Philistian came forth morning and evening, and stood forty days. And Isai said to David his son: Take for thy brethren an ephi of polent, and these ten loaves, and run into the camp to thy brethren, and these ten little cheeses thou shalt carry to the tribune: and shalt visit thy brethren, if they do well: and learn with whom they are placed. And Saul, and they, and all the children of Israel fought in the Valley of Terebinth against the Philisthiims. David therefore arose in the morning, &amp; commended the flock to the keeper: and he went loaded as Isai had commanded him. And he came to the place Magala, and to the host, which issuing out to fight had made a shout in the battle. For Israel had put themselves in array, and the Philisthiims on the contrary side were prepared. David therefore leaving the vessels which he had brought, under the hand of him that was keeper at the baggage, ran to the place of the battle, and asked if all things went well with his brethren. And when he yet spake to them, that man the bastard appeared coming up, named Goliath, the Philistian of Geth, coming up from the camp of the Philistians: and he speaking these self-same words, David heard them. And all the Israelites when they had seen the man, fled from his face, fearing him exceedingly. And some one of Israel said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What have I done? Is there not cause to speak? And he went a little aside from him to another, and said the self-same word. And the people answered him as before. And the words which David spake were heard, and told in the sight of Saul. To whom when he was brought, he spake unto him: Let not any man's heart be discouraged in him: I thy servant will go, and will fight against the Philistian. And Saul said to David: Thou art not able to resist this Philistian, nor to fight against him, because thou art a child, but he is a man of war from his youth. And David said to Saul: Thy servant did feed his father's flock, and there came a lion, or a bear, and took a ram out of the midst of the flock: and I pursued them, and struck them, &amp; plucked them out of their mouth, and they arose up against me, and I caught their chin, &amp; I strangled and slew them. For both the lion and the bear did I thy servant kill: therefore this uncircumcised Philistian also shall be as it were one of them. Now will I go &amp; take away the reproach of the people: for who is this uncircumcised Philistian, which hath been so hardy to curse the host of the living God? And David said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord which hath delivered me from the hand of the lion, and of the bear, he will deliver me from the hand of this Philistian. And Saul said to David: Go, &amp; our Lord be with thee. And Saul clothed David with his raiments, &amp; put an helmet of brass upon his head, and vested him with a coat of mail. David therefore being girded with his sword over his raiment, began to prove if he could go armed: for he was not accustomed. And David said to Saul: I cannot go so, because I am not used, &amp; he laid them off. And he took his staff, which he had always in his hands, &amp; he chose him five most bright stones out of the torrent, and cast them into the shepherd's scrip, which he had with him, &amp; he took a sling in his hand, &amp; went forth against the Philistian. And the Philistian went, going, &amp; approaching against David, and his esquire before him. And when the Philistian had seen and beheld David, he despised him. And he was a young man red, and beautiful to behold. And the Philistian said to David: Why^ am I a dog, that thou comest to me with a staff? And the Philistian cursed David in his gods, and said to David: Come to me, &amp; I will give thy flesh to the fowls of the air and the beasts of the earth. And David said to the Philistian: Thou comest to me with a sword &amp; spear, &amp; shield, but I come to thee in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the bands of Israel, whom thou hast defied this day, and our Lord shall give thee in my hand, &amp; shall strike thee, and take away thy head from thee: and I shall give the carcasses of the camp of the Philisthiims this day, to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the earth: that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel. And all this assembly shall know, that not in sword, nor in spear, doth our Lord save, for it is his battle, &amp; he will deliver you into our hands. When the Philistian therefore was risen up, &amp; came &amp; approached against David, David made haste, &amp; ran to the battle against the Philistian. And he put his hand into his scrip, and took one stone, and cast it with the sling, and fetching it about struck the Philistian in the forehead, and he fell on his face upon the earth. And David prevailed against the Philistian with sling and stone, and he struck, and slew the Philistian. And whereas David had no sword in his hand, he ran, and stood upon the Philistian, and took his sword, and drew it out of the scabbard, and slew him, &amp; cut off his head. And the Philisthiims seeing that the strongest of them was dead, did fly. And the men of Israel &amp; Juda rising up shouted, &amp; pursued the Philistians till they came into a valley to the gates of Accaron, and there fell wounded of the Philisthiims in the way of Saraim, as far as Geth, and as far as Accaron. And the children of Israel returning, after they had pursued the Philistians, invaded their camp. And David taking the head of the Philistian brought it into Jerusalem: but his armour he laid in his tabernacle. And at the same time that Saul saw David going forth against the Philistian, he said to Abner the Prince of the army: Of what stock is this young man descended, Abner? And Abner said: </div>
