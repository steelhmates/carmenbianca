What aileth thee, that thou art also wholly gone up into the house tops? full of clamour, a populous city, rejoicing: thy slain are not slain by the sword, nor dead in battle. All thy Princes are fled together, and are bound hard: all that were found, are bound together, they are fled far off. Therefore have I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Depart from me, I will weep bitterly: labour not to comfort me, for the destruction of the daughter of my people. For it is a day of slaughter, and conculcation, and weepings to our Lord the God of hosts, in the vale of visitation, searching the wall, and magnifical upon the mountain. And Aelam took quiver, chariot of the horseman, and the shield hath made the wall naked. And thy principal valleys shall be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall place themselves in the gate. And the covering of Juda shall be discovered, and thou shalt see in that day the armoury of the house of the forest. And you shall see the breaches of the city of David, because they are multiplied: and you have gathered together the waters of the lower pool, and have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and destroyed houses to fortify the wall. And you have made a lake between the two walls to the water of the old pool: &amp; you looked not up to him that made it, and the worker thereof long before you saw not. And our Lord the God of hosts shall call in that day to weeping, and to mourning, to baldness, and to girdle of sackcloth: and behold joy and gladness, to kill calves, and to slay rams, to eat flesh, and to drink wine: Let us eat and drink: for tomorrow we shall die. And the voice of the Lord of hosts was revealed in mine ears: If this iniquity shall be forgiven you until you die, saith our Lord the God of hosts. Thus saith our Lord the God of hosts: Go, get thee in to him, that dwelleth in the tabernacle, to Sobna the provost of the temple, and thou shalt say to him: What doest thou here, or as if thou were somebody here? Because thou hast cut thee out a sepulchre here, thou hast cut out a memorial diligently in an high place, a tabernacle for thee in a rock. Behold our Lord will cause thee to be carried away, as a cock is carried, and he will lift thee up as a garment. Crowning he will crown thee with tribulation, he will cast thee as a ball into a broad and large country: there shalt thou die, and there shall the chariot of thy glory be, the ignominy of the house of thy Lord. And I will expel thee from thy standing, and depose thee from thy ministry. And it shall be in that day: I will call my servant Eliacim the son of Helcias, and will clothe him with thy coat, and will strengthen him with thy girdle, and will give thy power into his hand: and he shall be as a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, &amp; to the house of Juda. And I will give the key of the house of David upon his shoulder: and he shall open, and there shall be none to shut: and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open. And I will fasten him as a pin in a sure place, and he shall be for a throne of glory to the house of his father. And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's house, diverse kinds of vessels, every little vessel, from vessels of cups even to every instrument of music. In that day saith the Lord of hosts, shall the pin be taken away, that was fastened in the sure place: and that which hung thereon, shall be broken, and fall, and perish, because our Lord hath spoken.</div>
