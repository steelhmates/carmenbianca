			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia, of Aggaeus and Zacharie. My soul praise thou our Lord, I will praise our Lord in my life: I will sing to my God as long as I shall be. Put not confidence in Princes: in the sons of men: in whom there is no salvation. His spirit shall go forth, and he shall return into his earth: in that day all their cogitations shall perish. Blessed is he, whose helper is the God of Jacob, his hope in our Lord his God: who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things that are in them. Which keepeth truth for ever, doth judgment for them that suffer wrong: giveth food to the hungry. Our Lord looseth the fettered: our Lord illuminateth the blind. Our Lord lifteth up the bruised, our Lord loveth the just. Our Lord keepeth strangers, the pupil and widow he will receive: and the ways of sinners he will destroy. Our Lord will reign for ever^ thy God, o Sion in generation &amp; generation.</div>
