			<div class='roleText'>All things have a time, and in their spaces all things pass under heaven. A time to be born, &amp; a time to die. A time to plant, &amp; a time to pluck up that which was planted. A time to kill, and a time to heal. A time to destroy, and a time to build. A time to weep, &amp; a time to laugh. A time to mourn, and a time to dance. A time to disperse stones, and a time to gather. A time to embrace, and a time to be far from embracings. A time to get, and a time to lose. A time to keep, and a time to cast away. A time to rent, and a time to sow together. A time to keep silence, &amp; a time to speak. A time to love, and a time of hatred. A time of war, and a time of peace. What hath man more of his labour? I have seen the affliction, which God hath given to the children of men, that they may be distracted in it. He hath made all things good in their time, and hath delivered the world to their disputation, and that man cannot find the work, which God hath wrought from the beginning unto the end. And I have known that there was no better thing than to rejoice, and to do well in his life. For every man, that eateth and drinketh, and seeth good of his labour, this is the gift of God. I have learned that all the works, which God hath made, persevere for ever: we cannot add any thing, nor take away from those things, which God hath made that he may be feared. That which hath been made, the same is permanent: the things that shall be, have already been: and God restoreth that which is past. I saw under the sun in the place of judgement impiety, and in the place of justice iniquity. And I said in my heart: the just and the impious God will judge, and then shall be the time of every thing. I said in my heart of the children of men, that God would prove them, and shew them to be like beasts. Therefore there is one death of man, and beasts, and the condition of both equal: as man dieth, so they also die: all things breathe alike, and man hath nothing more than beast: all things are subject to vanity, and all things pass to one place: of earth they were made, and into earth they return together. Who knoweth if the spirit of the children of Adam ascend upward, and if the spirit of beasts descend downward? And I have found that nothing is better than for a man to rejoice in his work, and that this is his portion. For who shall bring him to know the things that shall be after him?</div>
