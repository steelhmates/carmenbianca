			<div class='roleText'>AND you when you were dead by your offences and sins, wherein sometime you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of this air, of the spirit that now worketh on the children of diffidence, in whom also we all conversed sometime in the desires of our flesh, doing the will of the flesh and of thoughts, and were by nature the children of wrath as also the rest: but God (which is rich in mercy) for his exceeding charity wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead by sins, quickened us together in Christ, (by whose grace you are saved,) and raised us up with him, and hath made us sit with him in the celestials in Christ JESUS, that he might shew in the worlds succeeding, the aboundant riches of his grace, in bounty upon us in Christ JESUS. For by grace you are saved through faith (and that not of yourselves, for it is the gift of God) not of works, that no man glory. For we are his work, created in Christ JESUS in good works, which God hath prepared that we should walk in them. For the which cause be mindful that sometime you were Gentiles in the flesh, who were called prepuce, of that which is called circumcision in the flesh, made with hand: who were at that time without Christ, alienated from the conversation of Israel, and strangers of the testaments, having no hope of the promise, and without God in this world. But now in Christ JESUS, you that sometime were far off, are made nigh in the blood of Christ. For he is our peace, who hath made both one, and dissolving the middle wall of the partition, the enmities in his flesh: evacuating the law of commandments in decrees: that he may create the two in himself into one new man, making peace, and may reconcile both in one body to God by the cross, killing the enmities in himself. And coming he evangelized peace to you that were far off, and peace to them that were nigh. For by him we have access both in one Spirit to the Father. Now then you are not strangers and foreigners: but you are citizens of the saints, and the domesticals of God, built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets, JESUS Christ himself being the highest corner-stone: in whom all building framed together, groweth into an holy temple in our Lord, in whom you also are built together into an habitation of God in the Holy Ghost.</div>
