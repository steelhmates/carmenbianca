			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle of David. Lord my heart is not exalted: neither are mine eyes lofty. Neither have I walked in great matters: nor in marvelous things above me. If I was not humbly minded: but exalted my soul: As the weaned child is toward his mother, so retribution in my soul. Let Israel hope in our Lord, from henceforth now and for ever.</div>
