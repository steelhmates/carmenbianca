			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end for the morning enterprise, the Psalm of David. God my God have respect to me: why hast thou forsaken me? Far from my salvation are the words of my sins. My God I shall cry by day, &amp; thou wilt not hear: and by night, and not for folly unto me. But thou dwellest in the holy place, the praise of Israel. In thee our fathers have hoped: they hoped, and thou didst deliver them. They cried to thee, and were saved: they hoped in thee, and were not confounded. But I am a worm and no man: a reproach of men and outcast of the people. All that see me have scorned me: they have spoken with the lips, &amp; wagged the head. He hoped in the Lord, let him deliver him: let him save him, because he will him. Because thou art he that hast drawn me out of the womb: my hope from the breasts of my mother. Upon thee I have been cast from the matrice: from my mother's womb thou art my God, depart not from me. Because tribulation is very nigh: because there is not that will help. Many calves have compassed me: fat bulls have besieged me. They have opened their mouth upon me, as a lion ravening and roaring. As water I am poured out: and all my bones are dispersed. My heart is made as wax melting in the midst of my belly. My strength is withered as a potsherd, and my tongue cleaved to my jaws: and thou hast brought me down into the dust of death. Because many dogs have compassed me: the counsel of the malignant hath besieged me. They have digged my hands and my feet: they have numbered all my bones. But themselves have considered and beheld me: they have divided my garments among them: and upon my vesture they have cast lot. But thou Lord prolong not thy help from me: look toward my defence. Deliver, o God, my soul from the sword: and mine only one from the hand of the dog. Save me out of the lion's mouth: and my humility from the horns of unicorns. I will declare thy name to my brethren: in the midst of the Church I will praise thee, Ye that fear our Lord praise him: all the seed of Jacob glorify ye him. Let all the seed of Israel fear him: because he hath not contemned nor despised the petition of the poor. Neither hath he turned away his face from me: and when I cried to him he heard me, With thee is my praise in the great Church: I will render my vows in the sight of them that fear him. The poor shall eat, and shall be filled: and they shall praise our Lord that seek after him: their hearts shall live for ever and ever. All the ends of the earth shall remember, and be converted to our Lord. And all the families of the Gentiles shall adore in his sight. Because the kingdom is our Lord's: and he shall have dominion over the Gentiles. All the fat ones of the earth have eaten, and adored: in his sight shall all fall that descend into the earth. And my soul shall live to him: and my seed shall serve him. The generation to come shall be shewed to our Lord: and the heavens shall shew forth his justice to the people that shall be born, whom our Lord hath made.</div>
