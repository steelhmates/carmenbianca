			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. Blessed are all that fear our Lord, that walk in his ways. Because thou shalt eat the labours of thy hands: blessed art thou, and it shall be well with thee. Thy wife as a fruitful vine, in the sides of thy house. Thy children as young plants of olive-trees, round about thy table. Behold so shall the man be blessed, that feareth our Lord. Our Lord out of Sion bless thee: and that thou mayst see the good things of Jerusalem all the days of thy life. And that thou mayst see thy children's children, peace upon Israel.</div>
