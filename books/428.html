			<div class='roleText'>But after these things, when there was a festival day of our Lord, and a good dinner was made in Tobias' house, he said to his son: Go, and bring some of our tribe that fear God, to make merry with us. And when he had gone, returning he told him, that one of the children of Israel lay slain in the street. And he forthwith leaping up from his place at the table, leaving his dinner, came fasting to the body: and taking it up carried it to his house secretly, that when the sun should be down, he might warily bury him.

To these words his wife being angry answered: Thy hope is become vain manifestly, and thine alms now have appeared. And with these, and other such like words she upbraided him.</div>
