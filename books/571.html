			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, destroy not, to David, in the inscription of the title. If in very deed you speak justice: judge right things ye sons of men. For in the heart you work iniquities: in the earth your hands forge injustice. Sinners are alienated from the matrice, they have erred from the womb: they have spoken false things. They have fury according to the similitude of a serpent: as of the asp that is deaf, and stoppeth his ears. Which will not hear the voice of the enchanters, and of the sorcerer enchanting wisely. God shall break their teeth in their mouth, the cheek-tooth of the lions, our Lord will break in pieces. They shall come to nothing as water running down: he hath bent his bow till they be weakened. As wax that melteth, shall they be taken away: fire hath fallen on them, and they have not seen the sun. Before your thorns did understand the old briar: as living so in wrath he swalloweth them. The just shall rejoice when he shall see revenge: he shall wash his hands in the blood of a sinner. And man shall say: If certes there be fruit to the just: there is a God certes judging them on the earth.</div>
