Jacob therefore taking green rods of the poplar, and of the almond, and of the plane-trees, in part pilled them: and when the barks were taken off, in the parts that were pilled there appeared whiteness: but the parts that were whole remained green: and by this means the colour was made diverse. And he put them in the troughs, where the water was poured out: that when the flocks should come to drink, they might have the rods before their eyes, and in the sight of them conceive. And it came to pass that in the very heat of the ramming, the sheep beheld the rods, and brought forth spotted, and of diverse colours, and speckled. And Jacob divided the flock, and put the rods in the troughs before the eyes of the rams: and all the white and the black were Laban's, and the rest, Jacob's, when the flocks were separated one from the other. Therefore when the ewes went to ram, in the prime time Jacob put the rods in the troughs of water before the eyes of the rams, and of the ewes, that in looking upon them they might conceive: but when the later coming was, and the last conceiving, he did not put them. And those that were lateward became Laban's: and they of the prime time, Jacob's. And the man was enriched beyond measure, and he had many flock, women servants and men servants, camels and asses.</div>
