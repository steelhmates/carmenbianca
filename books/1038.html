			<div class='roleText'>In that day shall be a fountain lying open to the house of David, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: for the ablution of the sinner, and of the menstruous woman. And it shall be in that day, saith the Lord of hosts: I will destroy the names of idols out of the earth, and they shall be remembered no more: and the false Prophets, and the unclean spirit I will take away out of the earth. And it shall be when any man shall prophesy any more, his father &amp; his mother that begot him, shall say to him: Thou shalt not live: because thou hast spoken a lie in the name of our Lord. And his father, &amp; his mother, his parents shall strike him, when he shall prophesy. And it shall be: in that day the Prophets shall be confounded every one by his own vision, when he shall prophesy, neither shall they be covered with cloak of sackcloth, to lie: But he shall say: I am no Prophet, an husbandman am I: because Adam my example from my youth. And it shall be said to him: What are these wounds in the midst of thy hands? And he shall say: With these was I wounded in the house of them, that loved me. Sword be thou raised up upon my Pastor, and upon the man that cleaveth to me, saith the Lord of hosts: Strike the Pastor, and the sheep shall be dispersed: and I will turn my hand to the little ones. And there shall be in all the earth, saith our Lord: two parts in it shall be destroyed, and shall fail: and the third part shall be left in it. And I will bring the third part through fire, and will burn them as silver is burnt: and I will try them as gold is tried. They shall call my name, and I will hear them. I will say: Thou art my people; and they shall say: our Lord my God.</div>
