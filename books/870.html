			<div class='roleText'>Thus saith our Lord: Go, and take a potter's earthen bottle of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the Priests: and go forth to the valley of the son of Ennom, which is by the entry of the earthen gate: and there thou shalt preach the words, that I will speak to thee. And thou shalt say: Hear the word of our Lord ye kings of Juda, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring in affliction upon this place: so that every one that shall hear it, his ears shall tingle: because they have forsaken me, and have made this place strange: and they have sacrificed therein to strange gods, whom they, and their fathers, and the king of Juda have not known: and they have filled this place with the blood of innocents. And they have built the excelses of Baalim, to burn their children with fire for holocaust to Baalim: which I commanded not, nor have spoken of, neither have they ascended into my heart. Therefore behold the days come, saith our Lord: and this place shall no more be called, Topheth, and the valley of the son of Ennom, but the valley of slaughter. And I will dissipate the counsel of Juda and Jerusalem in this place: and I will subvert them with the sword in the sight of their enemies, and in the hand of them that seek their lives: and I will give their carcasses to be meat for the fowls of the air, and for the beasts of the earth. And I will make this city into astonishment, and into hissing: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, &amp; shall hiss upon all the plague thereof. And I will feed them with the flesh of their sons, and with the flesh of their daughters: and every one shall eat the flesh of his friend in the siege, and in the distress, wherein their enemies shall include them, and they that seek their lives. And thou shalt break the bottle in the sight of the men, that shall go with thee. And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: So will I break this people, and this city, as the potter's vessel is broken, that can no more be repaired: and they shall be buried in Topheth, because there is no other place to bury in. So will I do to this place, saith our Lord, and to the inhabitants thereof: and I will make this city as Topheth. And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Juda shall be as the place of Topheth, unclean: all houses, in the tops whereof they have sacrificed to all the host of heaven, and have offered libaments to strange gods. And Jeremy came from Topheth, whither our Lord had sent him to prophesy, and he stood in the court of the house of our Lord, and said to all the people: Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold I will bring in upon this city, and upon all the cities thereof all the evils that I have spoken against it: because they have hardened their neck, that they would not hear my words.</div>
