Howl thou fir-tree, because the cedar is fallen, because the magnifical are wasted: howl ye oaks of Basan, because the fenced forest is cut down. The voice of the howling of Pastors, because their magnificence is wasted: the voice of the roaring of lions, because the pride of Jordan is wasted. Thus saith our Lord my God: Feed thou the cattle of slaughter, which they that possessed, slew, and were not sorry, &amp; they sold them, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Blessed be our Lord, we are become rich: &amp; their Pastors spared them not. And I will spare no more upon the inhabitants of the earth, saith our Lord: behold I will deliver men, every one in his neighbour's hand, and in the hand of his king: and they shall cut the land in pieces, &amp; I will not deliver it out of their hand. And I will feed the cattle of slaughter for this, o ye poor of the stock: and I took unto me two rods, one I called Beauty, and the other I called Cord: and I fed the flock. And I cut off three Pastors in one month, and my soul shrunk together at them: for their soul also varied on me. And I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it die: and that which is cut off, be it cut off: and let the rest devour every one his neighbour's flesh. and I took my rod that was called beauty, &amp; I cut it off to make void my covenant, which I made with all peoples. And it was made void in that day: and so the poor of the flock that keep for me, understood that it is the word of the Lord. And I said to them: If it be good in your eyes, bring hither my hire: and if not, be quiet. And they weighed my hire thirty pieces of silver. And our Lord said to me, cast it forth to the statuary, a goodly price, that I was priced at by them. And I took the thirty pieces of silver: &amp; I threw them into the house of our Lord to the statuary. And I cut off my second rod, that was called Cord, that I might dissolve the brotherhood between Juda and Israel. And our Lord said to me: As yet take to thee the vessels of a foolish Pastor. Because lo I will raise up a Pastor in the land which shall not visit things forsaken, the thing dispersed he shall not seek, and the broken he shall not heal, and that which standeth he shall not nourish, and he shall eat the flesh of the fat ones, and their hoofs he shall dissolve. O pastor, and idol, leaving the flock: the sword upon his arm, &amp; upon his right eye: his arm shall be dried with withering, and his right eye waxing dark shall be obscured.</div>
