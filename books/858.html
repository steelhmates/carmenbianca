			<div class='roleText'>The word, that was made to Jeremy from our Lord, saying: Stand in the gate of the house of the Lord, and preach there this word, and say: Hear ye the word of our Lord all Juda, which go in by these gates, to adore our Lord. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Make your ways good, and your studies: and I will dwell with you in this place. Trust not in words of lying, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The temple of our Lord, the temple of our Lord, it is the temple of our Lord. For if you shall well direct your ways, and your studies: if you shall do judgement between a man and his neighbour, to the stranger, and to the pupil, and to the widow shall do no oppression, nor shed innocent blood in this place, and walk not after strange gods to your own evil: I will dwell with you in this place: in the land, which I gave to your fathers from the beginning and for ever. Behold you trust to yourselves in words of lying: which shall not profit you: to steal, to murder, to commit adultery, to swear falsely, to offer to Baalim, and to go after strange gods, which you know not. And you have come, and stood before me in this house, in which my name is invocated, and have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>We are delivered because we have done all these abominations. Why, is this house then wherein my name is invocated, in your eyes become a den of thieves? I, even I am: I have seen, saith our Lord. Go ye to my place in Silo, where my name dwelt from the beginning: and see what I have done to it for the malice of my people Israel: and now because you have done all these works, saith our Lord: and I have spoken to you early rising, and speaking, &amp; you have not heard: and I have called you, and you have not answered: I will do to this house, wherein my name is invocated, &amp; wherein you have confidence: and to the place which I have given you and your fathers, as I did to Silo. And I will cast you away from my face, as I have cast away all your brethren, the whole seed of Ephraim. Thou therefore pray not for this people, neither take unto thee praise and prayer for them, and resist me not: because I will not hear thee. Seest thou not what these do in the cities of Juda, and in the street of Jerusalem? The children gather the sticks, &amp; the fathers kindle the fire, &amp; the women temper the dough to make cakes unto the queen of heaven, and to offer libaments unto strange gods, and to provoke me to wrath. Why do they provoke me to wrath? Saith our Lord: and not themselves to the confusion of their own countenance? Therefore this saith our Lord God: Behold my fury, and my indignation is poured upon this place, upon men, and upon beasts, and upon the wood of the country, and upon the fruits of the land, and it shall be kindled, and shall not be quenched. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Add your holocausts to your victims, and eat ye the flesh. Because I spake not with your fathers, and I commanded them not in the day, that I brought them out of the land of Aegypt, touching the word of holocausts and victims. But this word I commanded them, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hear ye my voice, and I will be your God, and you shall be my people: and walk ye in all the way, that I have commanded you, that it may be well with you. And they heard not, nor inclined their ear: but have gone in their pleasures, and in the perversity of their wicked heart: and have been made backward and not forward, from the day that their fathers came out of the land of Aegypt, even to this day. And I have sent to you all my servants the Prophets by day, rising early, and sending. And they have not heard me, nor inclined their ear: but they have hardened their neck, and have wrought worse than their fathers. And thou shalt speak unto them all these words, and they will not hear thee: and thou shalt call them, and they will not answer thee. And thou shalt say to them: This is the nation which hath not heard the voice of the Lord their God, nor received discipline: faith is perished, and is taken away out of their mouth. Poll thy hair, and cast it away, and take lamentation on high: because our Lord hath cast off, and hath left the generation of his fury, because the children of Juda have done evil in mine eyes, saith our Lord. They have put their stumbling blocks in the house, wherein my name is invocated, that they might pollute it: and they have built the excelses of Topheth, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, that they might burn their sons, and their daughters with fire: which things I commanded not, nor thought in my heart. Therefore lo the days shall come, saith our Lord, and it shall no more be said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Topheth, and the valley of the son of Ennom: but the valley of slaughter: and they shall bury in Topheth because there is no place. And the carcass of this people shall be for meats to the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the land, and there shall be none to drive them away. And I will make to cease out of the cities of Juda, and out of the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be in desolation.</div>
