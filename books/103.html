			<div class='roleText'>The man, in whose skin and flesh shall arise a diverse colour or a blister, or any thing as it were shining, that is to say the plague of the leprosy, shall be brought to Aaron the Priest, or any one of his sons. Who seeing the leprosy in his skin, &amp; the hair turned into a white colour, and the form it-self of the leprosy lower than the skin, and the other flesh: it is the plague of the leprosy, and at his arbitrement he shall be separated. But if there be a shining whiteness in the skin, and not lower than the other flesh, and the hair of the old colour, the Priest shall shut him up seven days, and the seventh day he shall view him: and if the leprosy be grown no farther, nor hath passed the former limits in the skin, again he shall shut him up other seven days. And the seventh day he shall behold: if the leprosy be somewhat obscure, and not grown in the skin, he shall cleanse him, because it is a scab: and the man shall wash his cloths, and shall be clean. And if the leprosy grow again, after that he was seen of the Priest and restored to cleanness, he shall be brought unto him, and shall be condemned of uncleanness. If the plague of the leprosy be in a man, he shall be brought to the Priest, and he shall view him. And when there is a white colour in the skin, and hath changed the look of the hair, and the flesh also it-self appear quick: it shall be judged a very old leprosy, and grown into the skin. The Priest therefore shall contaminate him, and shall not shut him up, because he is unclean evidently. But if the leprosy spring forth running about in the skin, and cover all the flesh from the head to the feet, whatsoever falleth under the sight of the eyes, the Priest shall view him, and shall judge that he is taken with a most clean leprosy: for that it is all turned into whiteness, and therefore the man shall be clean. But when there shall appear in him quick flesh, then by the judgment of the Priest he shall be polluted, and shall be reputed among the unclean, for quick flesh if it be spotted with leprosy, is unclean. And if again it be turned into whiteness, and cover all the man, the Priest shall view him, and shall judge him to be clean. And the flesh and the skin wherein a boil is risen, an healed, and in the place of the boil there appear a white scar, or somewhat red, the man shall be brought to the Priest: and when he shall see the place of the leprosy lower than the other flesh; and the hair turned into whiteness, he shall contaminate him: for the plague of leprosy is risen in the boil. But if the hair be of the old colour, and the scar somewhat obscure, &amp; be not lower than next flesh, he shall shut him up seven days. And if it be grown farther; he shall judge him to have the leprosy: but if it stay in his place, it is the scar of a boil, and the man shall be clean. And the flesh and skin, that fire hath burnt, and being healed hath a white or a red scar, the Priest shall consider it, and lo it is turned into whiteness, and the place thereof is lower than the other skin: he shall contaminate him, because the plague of leprosy is risen in the scar. But if the colour of the hair be not changed, nor the blemish lower than the other flesh, and the form it-self of the leprosy be somewhat obscure, he shall shut him up seven days, &amp; the seventh day he shall behold him: if the leprosy be grown farther in the skin, he shall contaminate him, but if the whiteness stay in his place, not very clear, it is the plague of a burning, and therefore he shall be cleansed, because it is the scar of a burning. Man, or woman, in whose head or beard the leprosy riseth, the Priest shall see them. and if the place be lower than the other flesh, and the hair yellow, and thinner than it was wont; he shall contaminate them, because it is the leprosy of the head and the beard. But if he perceive the place of the spot equal with the flesh near unto it, and the hair black: he shall shut him up seven days, and in the seventh day he shall look upon it. If the spot be not grown, and the hair be of his own colour, and the place of the plague even with the other flesh: the man shall be shaven saving the place of the spot, and shall be shut up other seven days. If the seventh day the plague seem to have stayed in his place, &amp; not lower than the other flesh, he shall cleanse him, and his cloths being washed he shall be clean. But if after his cleansing the spot be grown again in the skin, he shall no more seek whether the hair be changed into a yellow colour, because he is evidently unclean. Moreover if the spot be stayed, &amp; the hair be black, let him know that the man is healed, and let him boldly pronounce him clean. Man, or woman, in whose skin appeareth whiteness, the Priest shall view them. If he find that whiteness somewhat obscure shineth in the skin, let him know that it is not the leprosy, but a spot of white colour and that the man is clean. The man whose hair falleth off from his head, is bald and clean: and if the hair fall from his forehead, he is bald before and clean. But if in the baldness or in the baldness before there be risen a white or reddish colour, and the Priest perceive this, he shall condemn him undoubtedly of leprosy, which is risen in the baldness. Whosoever therefore shall be defiled with leprosy &amp; is separated at the arbitrement of the Priest, shall have his cloths hanging loose, his head bare, his mouth covered with a cloth, he shall cry himself polluted and unclean. All the time that he is a leper &amp; unclean, he shall dwell alone without the camp. A woollen or linen garment, that shall have the leprosy in the warp, and the woof, or else a skin, or whatsoever is made of a skin, if it be a white or reddish spot, it shall be reputed infected with leprosy, and shall be shewed to the Priest. Who having considered it shall shut it up seven days: and the seventh day again beholding it, if he find that it is grown, it is a leprosy that continueth: he shall judge the garment polluted, and every thing wherein it shall be found, and therefore it shall be burnt with fire. But if he see that it is not grown, he shall command, and they shall wash that, wherein the leprosy is, and he shall shut it up other seven days. And when he shall see that the old shape is not returned, neither yet that the leprosy is grown farther, he shall judge it unclean, and burn it with fire, for that the leprosy is spread in the outside of the garment or through the whole. But if the place of the leprosy be somewhat obscure, after that the garment is washed, he shall break it off, and divide it from that which is found. And if besides in those places, that before were without spot, there appear a flying and wandering leprosy: it must be burnt with fire: if it be ceased, he shall wash with water the parts that be pure, the second time, and they shall be clean. This is the law of the leprosy of a woollen and linen garment, of the warp and the woof, and of all stuff of skins, how it ought to be cleansed or contaminated.</div>
