			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, destroy not, to David in the inscription of the title, when he fled from the face of Saul into the cave. Have mercy on me, o God, have mercy on me: because my soul hath trusted in thee. And I will hope in the shadow of thy wings, until iniquity pass. I will cry to God the highest: God that hath done me good. He sent from heaven, and delivered me: he hath given into reproach them that trod upon me. God hath sent his mercy and his truth, and hath delivered my soul out of the midst of lions' whelps: I slept troubled. The sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows: and their tongue a sharp sword. Be exalted above the heavens, o God: and thy glory upon all the earth. They prepared a snare for my feet: and bowed down my soul. They digged a pit before my face: and they are fallen into it. My heart is ready, o God, my heart is ready: I will sing, and say a Psalm. Arise my glory, arise psalter and harp: I will arise early. I will confess to thee among peoples, o Lord: and I will say a Psalm to thee among the Gentiles. Because thy mercy is magnified even to the heavens, and thy truth even to the clouds. Be exalted above the heavens o God: and thy glory upon all the earth.</div>
