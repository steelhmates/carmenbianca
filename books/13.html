			<div class='roleText'>Abram therefore ascended out of Aegypt, he and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him to the south coast. And he was very rich in possession of gold and silver. And he returned by the way that he came, from the south unto Bethel, even to the place where before he had pitched a tabernacle between Bethel and Hai: in the place of the altar which he had made before, and there he called upon the name of our Lord. But Lot also that was with Abram had flocks of sheep, and herds of beasts, and tents. Neither was the land able to receive them for to dwell together: for their substance was much, and they could not dwell together. Whereupon also there arose strife amongst the herdsmen of Abram and of Lot. And that time the Chananite and the Pherisite dwelled in that country. Abram therefore said to Lot: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lot therefore lifting up his eyes, saw all the country about Jordan, which was watered throughout before that our Lord subverted Sodome and Gomorre, as the Paradise of our Lord, and like as Aegypt as men come unto Segor. And Lot chose unto him the country about Jordan, and he departed from the East: and they were separated either brother from the other. Abram dwelt in the land of Chanaan: and Lot abode in the towns that were about Jordan, and dwelt in Sodome. And the men of Sodome were very wicked, and sinners before the face of our Lord out of measure. And our Lord said to Abram, after that Lot was separated from him: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lift up thine eyes, and look from the place wherein thou now art, to the north and south, to the east and west: All the land which thou seest will I give to thee, and to thy seed for ever. And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: if any man be able to number the dust of the earth, thy seed also shall he be able to number. Arise and walk through the land in the length, and in the breadth thereof: for I will give it to thee. </div>
