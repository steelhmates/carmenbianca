			<div class='roleText'>In the beginning of the kingdom of Joakim, the son of Josias king of Juda, was this word made to Jeremy from our Lord, saying: Thus saith our Lord to me: Make thee bands, and chains: and thou shalt put them on thy neck. And thou shalt send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Sidon: by the hand of the messengers, that are come to Jerusalem to Sedecias the king of Juda. And thou shalt command them that they speak to their lords: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Thus shall you say to your lords: I made the earth, and men, and the beasts, that are upon the face of the earth, in my great strength, and in my stretched out arm: and I have given it to him, that pleased in mine eyes. And now therefore I have given all these lands into the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon my servant: moreover also the beasts of the field I have given him, to serve him. And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son: till the time come of his land and of himself: and many nations and great kings shall serve him. But the nation and kingdom that shall not serve Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and whosoever shall not bow his neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon: I will visit upon that nation with sword, and with famine, and with pestilence, saith our Lord: till I consume them in his hand. You therefore hear not your Prophets, and diviners, and dreamers, and soothsayers, and sorcerers, that say to you: You shall not serve the king of Babylon. Because they prophesy lies unto you: that they may make you far from your country, &amp; cast you out, and you perish. But the nation, that shall submit their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and shall serve him, the same will I let alone in their own land, saith our Lord: and they shall husband it, and dwell in it. And to Sedecias the king of Juda, I have spoken according to all these words, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Submit your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, and his people, and you shall live. Why will you die, thou and thy people with the sword, and famine, &amp; the pestilence, as the Lord hath spoken to the nation, that will not serve the king of Babylon? Hear not the words of the Prophets that say to you: You shall not serve the king of Babylon: because they speak a lie to you. Because I sent them not, saith our Lord: &amp; they prophesy in my name falsely: that they may cast you out, &amp; you perish, as well you, as the Prophets that prophesy unto you. And to the Priests, and to this people I have spoken, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Behold the vessels of our Lord shall return out of Babylon even now quickly, for they prophesy a lie unto you. Therefore hear them not, but serve the king of Babylon, that you may live. Why is this city given into desolation? And if they be Prophets, and the word of our Lord be in them: let them interpose themselves before the Lord of hosts, that the vessels which were left in the house of our Lord, &amp; in the house of the king of Juda, and in Jerusalem, come not into Babylon. Because thus saith the Lord of hosts to the pillars, and to the sea, and to the feet, and to the rest of the vessels, that are remaining in this city. Which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon, took not when he transported Jechonias the son of Joakim, the king of Juda, from Jerusalem into Babylon, and all the great men of Juda and Jerusalem. Because thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel to the vessels, that are left in the house of our Lord, and in the house of the king of Juda and Jerusalem: They shall be transported into Babylon, and there they shall be until the day of their visitation, saith our Lord: and I will cause them to be brought, and to be restored in this place.</div>
