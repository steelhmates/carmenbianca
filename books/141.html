			<div class='roleText'>Balaam the son of Beor hath said: The man hath said whose eye is stopped: The hearer of the words of God hath said, he that hath beholden the vision of the Omnipotent, he that falleth, and so his eyes are opened: How beautiful are thy tabernacles, o Jacob, and thy tents, o Israel! As woody valleys, as watered gardens beside the rivers, as tabernacles which the Lord hath pitched, as cedars by the waters' side. Water shall flow out of his bucket, and his seed shall be into many waters. For Agag shall his king be taken away, and his kingdom shall be taken away. God hath brought him out of Aegypt, whose strength is like to the Rhinoceros. They shall devour nations his enemies, and break their bones, and pierce them with arrows. Lying^ he hath slept as a lion, and as a lioness, whom none shall be bold to raise up. He that blesseth thee, himself also shall be blessed: he that curseth thee, shall be reputed accurst. </div>

But yet going to my people, I will give thee counsel, what thy people shall do to this people in the last time. </div>
