			<div class='roleText'>For Sion I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem, I will not rest, till her just one come forth as brightness, &amp; her Saviour be kindled as a lamp. And the Gentiles shall see thy just one, and all kings thy noble one: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the mouth of our Lord shall name. And thou shalt be a crown of glory in the hand of our Lord, &amp; the diadem of a kingdom in the hand of thy God. Thou shalt no more be called, Forsaken: &amp; thy land shall no more be called, Desolate: But thou shalt be called, My will in her, and thy land inhabited, because it hath well pleased our Lord in thee: &amp; thy land shall be inhabited. For the young man shall dwell with the virgin, and thy children shall dwell in thee. And the bridegroom shall rejoice upon the bride, &amp; thy God shall rejoice upon thee. Upon thy walls, Jerusalem, I have appointed watch-men, all the day, and all the night, for ever they shall not hold their peace. You that remember our Lord, hold not your peace, &amp; give not silence to him, until he establish, and until he make Jerusalem the praise in the earth. Our Lord hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength: If I shall give thy wheat any more to be meat for thine enemies: and if the strange children shall drink thy wine, wherein thou hast laboured. Because they that shall gather it together, shall eat it, and shall praise the Lord: and they that carry it together, shall drink it in my holy courts. Pass ye, pass ye through the gates, prepare a way for the people, make the journey plain, &amp; pick up the stones, &amp; lift up the sign to the peoples. Behold our Lord hath made heard in the ends of the earth, tell the daughter of Sion: Behold thy Saviour cometh: behold his reward is with him, and his work before him. And they shall call them, The holy people, the redeemed of our Lord. But thou shalt be called, A city sought for, and not Forsaken.</div>
