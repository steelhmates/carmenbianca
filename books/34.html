Whom when Sichem had seen, the son of Hemor the Hevite, the Prince of that land, he was in love with her: and he took her away, and lay with her, by force ravishing the virgin. And his soul was fast knit unto her, and whereas she was sad, he comforted her with sweet words. And going to Hemor his father, he said: </div>

And when Hemor, Sichem's father was come forth to speak unto Jacob, behold his sons came out of the field; and hearing what had passed, they were passing wrath, because he had done a foul thing in Israel, and committed an unlawful fact in ravishing Jacob's daughter. Hemor therefore spake to them: </div>

When they were gone forth, the other sons of Jacob ran in upon them that were slain, and spoiled the city in revenge of the rape. And wasting all things that were in their houses and fields, their sheep and herds, and asses, their little ones also, and their wives they led away captive.
