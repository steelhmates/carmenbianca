And when he was come down to Bethel, the children of the prophets, that were in Bethel, went forth to Eliseus, and said to him: Doest thou know, that this day our Lord will take thy master from thee? Who answered: I also know it: hold your peace. And Elias said to Eliseus: Sit here, because our Lord hath sent me into Jericho. And he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord liveth, and thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee: They went therefore both together, and fifty men of the children of the Prophets followed them, who also stood over against them, far off: but they two stood upon Jordan. And Elias took his mantle, and folded it together, and smote the waters, which were divided into two parts, and they both passed over by the dry land. And when they were over, Elias said to Eliseus: Ask what thou wilt have me do for thee, before I be taken from thee. And Eliseus said: </div>

Who answered: Thou hast asked a hard thing: Nevertheless if thou see me when I shall be taken from thee, thou shalt have that thou hast asked: but if thou see me not, thou shalt not have it.

And Eliseus saw him, and cried: My father, my father, the chariot of Israel and the guider thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took his garments, and rent them in two pieces. And he took up the mantle of Elias, that was fallen to him: and returning he stood upon the bank of Jordan, and with the mantle of Elias, that fell down to him, he smote the waters, and they were not divided. And he said: </div>
