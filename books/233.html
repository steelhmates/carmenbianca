			<div class='roleText'>In the days of one Judge, when the Judges ruled, there came a famine in the Land. And there went a man of Bethlehem Juda to sojourn in the land of Moab, with his wife and two children. Himself was called Elimelech, and his wife Noemi: and his two sons, the one Mahalon, and the other Chelion, Ephraites of Bethlehem Juda. And entering into the country of Moab, they abode there. And Elimelech the husband of Noemi died: and she remained with her sons. Who took wives of the Moabites, of the which one was called Orpha, and the other Ruth. And they abode there ten years, and both died, to wit, Mahalon and Chelion: and the woman remained destitute of her two children &amp; her husband. And she arose to go into her country with both her daughters in law from the country of Moab: for she had heard that our Lord had respected his people, &amp; had given them victuals. She therefore went forth from the place of her peregrination, with both her daughters in law: and being now set in the way to return into the Land of Juda, she said to them: Go into your mother's house, our Lord do mercy with you, as you have done with the dead and with me. Grant he unto you to find rest in the house of your husbands, which you shall take. And she kissed them. Who lifting up their voice began to weep, &amp; to say: We will go on with thee to thy people. To whom she answered: Return my daughters, why come you with me? Shall I have sons any more in my womb, that you may hope for husbands of me? Return my daughters, and go your ways: for I am now spent with old age, and not fit for wedlock. Although I might conceive this night, and bear children, if you would expect till they grow, and be of man's age, you shall be old women before you marry. Do not so my daughters, I beseech you: for your distress doth the more grieve me, &amp; the hand of our Lord is come forth against me. Therefore lifting up their voice they began to weep again: Orpha kissed her mother in law, and returned: Ruth cleaved to her mother in law, to whom Noemi said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Behold thy kinswoman is returned to her people, and to her gods, go with her. Who answered: Be not against me, to the end that I should leave thee and depart: for whither soever thou shalt go, I will go: and where thou shalt abide, I also will abide. Thy people my people, and thy God my God. The land that shall receive thee dying, in the same will I die: and there will I take a place for my burial. These things do God to me, &amp; these things add he, if death only shall not separate me and thee. Noemi therefore seeing that Ruth with a steadfast mind had determined to go forward with her, would not be against it, nor persuade her any more to return to her friends: and they went forth together, and came into Bethlehem. Who being entered into the city, a brute was quickly spread among them: and the women said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Call me not Noemi (that is to say, beautiful) but call me Mara (that is to say, bitter) because with bitterness hath the Almighty very much replenished me. I went forth full, and our Lord hath brought me back empty. Why therefore do you call me Noemi whom our Lord hath humbled, and the Almighty hath afflicted? Noemi therefore came with Ruth the Moabite her daughter in law, from the Land of her peregrination: and returned into Bethlehem, when barley was first reaped.</div>
