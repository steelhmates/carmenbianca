And all the king's servants, that were in the doors of his palace, bowed their knees, and adored Aman: for so the Emperor had commanded them: only Mardocheus did not bow his knee, nor adore him. To whom the king's servants, that were chief at the doors of the palace, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why doest thou above the rest not observe the king's commandment? And when they said this often, and he would not hear, they told Aman, desirous to know whether he would persevere in his sentence: for he had told them that he was a Jew. Which Aman had heard, &amp; had proved by experience that Mardocheus bowed not his knee unto him, nor adored him, he was angry exceedingly. And he counted it a matter of nothing to lay his hands upon Mardocheus alone: for he had heard that he was of the nation of the Jews, and he would rather destroy all the nation of the Jews, that were in the Kingdom of Assuerus. The first month (which is called Nisan) in the twelfth year of the reign of Assuerus, the lot was cast into a pot which in Hebrew is called Phur, before Aman, in what day and what month the nation of the Jews should be slain: and there came forth the twelfth month, which is called Adar. And Aman said to king Assuerus: There is a people dispersed through all the Provinces of thy kingdom, and separated one from another, using new laws and ceremonies, moreover also contemning the king's ordinances: And thou knowest very well that it is not expedient for thy kingdom that they wax insolent by liberty. If it please thee, decree that they may perish, &amp; I will pay ten thousand talents to the cofferers of the treasure. The king therefore took the ring that he used, from his hand, and gave it to Aman the son of Amadathi of the progeny of Agag, the enemy of the Jews, and he said to him: The silver which thou doest promise, be it thine: but concerning the people do that which pleaseth thee. And the king's scribes were called in the first month, Nisan, the thirteenth day of the same month: and it was written, as Aman had commanded, to all the king's lieutenants, and judges of the Provinces, and of diverse nations, as every nation could read, and hear according to the variety of languages, in the name of king Assuerus: and the letters signed with his ring, were sent by the king's posts to all provinces, that they should kill and destroy all the Jews, from boy unto old man, children, and women, in one day, that is, in the thirteenth of the twelfth month, which is called Adar, and should spoil them of their goods. And the content of the letters was this, that all Provinces might know, and prepare themselves against the day aforesaid. The posts that were sent, made haste to fulfill the king's commandment. And immediately the edict hung in Susan, the king and Aman feasting, and all the Jews that were in the city weeping.</div>
