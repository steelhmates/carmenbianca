			<div class='roleText'>And king Salomon was reigning over all Israel: and these were the princes which he had: Azarias the son of Sadoc the priest: Elihoreph, and Ahia the sons of Sisa Scribes: Josaphat the son of Ahilud, register: Banaias the son of Joiada, over the army: and Sadoc, and Abiathar priests. Azarias the son of Nathan, over them that assisted the king: Zabud the son of Nathan priest, the king's friend: and Ahizar governor of the house: and Adoniram the son of Abda over the tributes. And Salomon had twelve governors over all Israel, which served out victuals for the king and for his house: for every one ministered necessaries, each man his month in the year. And these are their names: Benhur in mount Ephraim. Bendecar, in Macces, and in Salebim, and in Bethsames, and in Elon, and in Bethhanan. Benhesed in Aruboth: his was Socho, and all the land Epher. Benabinadab, whose was all Nepha Dor, had Tapheth the daughter of Salomon to wife. Bana the son of Ahilud governed Thanach and Mageddo, and all Bethsan, which is beside Sarthana under Jezrahel, from Bethsan unto Abelmehula over against Jecmaan. Bengaber in Ramoth Galaad: had Avothjair the son of Manasses in Galaad, he was chief in all the country of Argob, which is in Basan, three score cities great and walled, which had brazen locks. Ahinadab the son of Addo was chief in Manaim. Achimaas in Nephthali: yea he also had Basemath the daughter of Salomon in marriage. Baana the son of Husi, in Aser, and in Baloth. Josaphat the son of Pharue, in Issachar. Semei the son of Ela, in Benjamin. Gaber the son of Uri, in the land of Galaad in the land of Sehon the king of the Ammorrheite, &amp; of Og the king of Basan, over all things that were in that Land. Juda and Israel innumerable, as the sand of the sea in multitude: eating, and drinking, and rejoicing. And Salomon was in his dominion, having all the Kingdoms with him from the river of the land of the Philisthiims unto the border of Aegypt: of them that offered him presents, &amp; served him all the days of his life. And the provision of Salomon was every day thirty measures of flour, &amp; threescore measures of meal, ten fat oxen and twenty pasture-fed, &amp; a hundred rams, beside the venison of harts, roes, and buffles, and fatted fowl. For he possessed all the country, which was beyond the river, from Thapsa unto Gaza, and all the kings of those countries: and he had peace on every side round about. And Juda and Israel dwelt without any fear, every one under his vine, and under his fig tree, from Dan unto Bersabee all the days of Salomon. And Salomon had forty thousand stalls of chariot-horses, and twelve thousand for the saddle. And the foresaid governors of the king fed them: yea and the necessaries of king Salomon's table they gave forth with great care in their time. Barley also and straw for the horses, and beasts, they brought to the place, where the king was, according as it was appointed them. God also gave wisdom to Salomon and prudence exceeding much, and latitude of heart as the sand that is in the sea shore. And the wisdom of Salomon passed the wisdom of all them in the east, and of the Aegyptians, and he was wiser than all men: wiser than Ethan the Ezralite, and Heman, and Chalcol, &amp; Dorda the sons of Mahol, and he was renowned in all nations round about. Salomon also spake three thousand parables: and his songs were a thousand &amp; five. And he disputed of trees from the cedar that is in Libanus, unto the hyssop which cometh out of the wall: &amp; he discoursed of beasts, and fowls, and creeping worms, and fishes. And there came from all people to hear the wisdom of Salomon, and from all the kings of the earth, which heard his wisdom.</div>
