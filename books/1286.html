			<div class='roleText'>BUT the sum concerning those things which be said, is: We have such an high Priest, who is set on the right hand of the seat of majesty in the heavens. A Minister of the Holies, and of the true tabernacle, which our Lord pight and not man. For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and hosts, wherefore it is necessary that he also have something that he may offer: if then he were upon the earth, neither were he a priest: whereas there were that did offer gifts according to the Law, that serve the exampler and shadow of heavenly things. As it was answered Moyses, when he finished the tabernacle, See (quoth he) that thou make all things according to the exampler which was shewed thee in the mount. But now he hath obtained a better ministry, by so much as he is Mediator of a better testament, which is established in better promises. For if that former had been void of fault, there should not certes a place of a second been sought. For blaming them, he saith: Behold the days shall come, saith our Lord: and I will consummate upon the house of Israel, and upon the house of Juda a new Testament: not according to the testament which I made to their fathers in the day that I took their hand to bring them out of the land of Aegypt: because they did not continue in my testament: and I neglected them, saith our Lord. For this is the Testament which I will dispose to the house of Israel after those days, saith our Lord: Giving my laws into their mind, and in their heart will I superscribe them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people: and every one shall not teach his neighbour, and every one his brother, saying, Know our Lord: because all shall know me from the lesser to the greater of them: because I will be merciful to their iniquities, &amp; their sins I will not now remember. And in saying a new, the former he hath made old. And that which groweth ancient and waxed old, is nigh to utter decay.</div>
