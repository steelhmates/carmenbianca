			<div class='roleText'>To David, when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he dismist him, and he went away I will bless our Lord at all time: his praise always in my mouth. In our Lord my soul shall be praised: let the mild hear, and rejoice. Magnify ye our Lord with me: and let us exalt his name for ever. I have sought out our Lord, and he hath heard me: and from all my tribulations he hath delivered me. Come ye to him, and be illuminated: and your faces shall not be confounded. This poor man hath cried, and our Lord hath heard him: and from all his tribulations he hath saved him. The Angel of our Lord shall put in himself about them that fear him: and shall deliver them. Taste ye, and see that our Lord is sweet: blessed is the man, that hopeth in him. Fear ye our Lord all ye his Saints: because there is no lack to them that fear him. The rich have wanted, and have been hungry: but they that seek after our Lord shall not be diminished of any good. Come children, hear me: I will teach you the fear of our Lord. who is the man that will have life: loveth to see good days? Stay thy tongue from evil: and thy lips that they speak not guile. Turn away from evil, and do good: seek after peace and pursue it. The eyes of our Lord upon the just: and his ears unto their prayers. But the countenance of our Lord is upon them that do evil things: to destroy their memory out of the earth. The just have cried, and our Lord hath heard them: and out of all their tribulations he hath delivered them. Our Lord is nigh to them, that are of a contrite heart: and the humble of spirit he will save. Many are the tribulations of the just: and out of all these our Lord will deliver them. Our Lord keepeth all their bones: there shall not one of them be broken. The death of sinners is very ill: and they that hate the just shall offend. Our Lord will redeem the souls of his servants: and all that hope in him shall not offend.</div>
