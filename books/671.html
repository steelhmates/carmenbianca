			<div class='roleText'>My son keep my words, and my precepts hide with thee. Son, keep my commandments, and thou shalt live: and my law as the apple of thine eye: bind it on thy fingers, write it in the tables of thy heart. Say to wisdom, thou art my sister: &amp; call prudence thy friend, that she may keep thee from the strange woman, and from the foreigner which maketh her words sweet. For out of the window of my house I looked out through the lattice, and I see little ones, I behold a foolish youngman, which passeth through the streets by the corner, and goeth nigh the way of her house, in the dark the day being toward evening, in the darkness of the night, and dimness. And behold the woman meeteth him in harlot's attire, prepared to deceive souls: babbling and wandering, impatient of rest, nor able to consist in the house on her feet, now abroad, now in the streets, now lying in wait near the corners. And taking the youngman she kisseth him, and with malapert countenance speaketh fair, saying: I vowed victims for welfare, this day I have payed my vows. Therefore I am come forth to meet thee, desirous to see, and I have found thee. I have woven my bed with cords, I have adorned it with tapestry pictured out of Aegypt. I have sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. Come let us be inebriated with breasts, and let us enjoy desired embracings, till the day appear. For my husband is not at home, he is gone a very long journey. he carried with him a bag of money: in the day of the full moon he will return to his house. She entangled him with many words, and with flattery of lips drew him. Immediately he followeth her as an oxe led to be a victim, &amp; as a lamb playing the wanton, and not knowing that he is drawn as a fool to bonds, till the arrow pierce his liver: as if a bird should make haste to the snare, and knoweth not that his life is in danger. Now therefore my son, hear me, and attend to the words of my mouth. Let not thy mind be drawn away in her ways: neither be thou deceived with her paths. For she hath cast down many wounded, and all the most strong are slain by her. Her house the ways of hell, penetrating to the inner parts of the death.</div>
