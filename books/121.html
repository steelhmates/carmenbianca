			<div class='roleText'>Take the sum of the sons of Caath out of the midst of the Levites, by their houses and families, from the thirtieth year and upward, unto the fiftieth year, of all that go in to stand and to minister in the tabernacle of covenant. This is the service of the sons of Caath: when the camp is to remove, Aaron and his sons shall enter into the tabernacle of covenant, and Sanctum Sanctorum, and shall take down the veil that hangeth before the door, and shall wrap in it the ark of testimony, and shall cover it again with a cover of Ianthine skins, and shall spread over it a cloth all of hyacinth, and shall draw in the bars. The table also of proposition they shall wrap in a cloth of hyacinth, and shall put with it the censers and little mortars, the goblets and cups to pour the libaments: the breads shall be always on it: and they shall spread over it a cloth of scarlet, which again they shall cover with a veil of ianthine skins, and shall put in the bars. They shall take also a cloth of hyacinth wherewith they shall cover the candlestick with the lamps and tongs thereof and snuffers and all the vessels of oil, which are necessary for the dressing of the lamps: and over all they shall put a cover of ianthine skins, and put in the bars. Moreover the golden altar also they shall wrap in a cloth of hyacinth, and shall spread over it a cover of ianthine skins, and put in the bars. All the vessels wherewith the ministration is done in the Sanctuary, they shall wrap in a cloth of hyacinth and shall spread over it a cover of ianthine skins, and put in bars. But the altar also they shall make clean from the ashes, &amp; shall wrap it in a purple cloth, and shall put with it all the vessels, that they use in the ministry thereof, that is to say, fire pans, flesh hooks &amp; forks, pot-hooks and shovels. All the vessels of the altar together they shall cover with a veil of ianthine skins, and shall put in the bars. And when Aaron and his sons have wrapped up the Sanctuary &amp; the vessels thereof in the removing of the camp, then shall the sons of Caath enter in to carry the things wrapped up: and they shall not touch the vessels of the Sanctuary, lest they die. These are the burdens of the sons of Caath in the tabernacle of covenant: over whom shall be Eleazar the son of Aaron the Priest, to whose charge pertaineth the oil to dress the lamps, and the incense of composition, and the sacrifice, that is always offered, and the oil of unction, and whatsoever pertaineth to the service of the tabernacle, and of all the vessels, that are in the Sanctuary. </div>

Aaron and his sons shall enter, and they shall dispose the charges of every one, and shall divide what every one must carry. Let others by no curiosity see the things that are in the Sanctuary before they be wrapped up, otherwise they shall die. </div>
