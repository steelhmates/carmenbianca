			<div class='roleText'>If a soul sin, and hear the voice of one swearing, and be witness, because either he himself saw, or is privy to it: unless he utter it, he shall bear his iniquity. The soul that toucheth any unclean thing, either that which was killed of a beast, or died of itself, or any other thing that creepeth: and forgeteth his uncleanness, is guilty, and hath offended: and if he touch any thing of the uncleanness of man, according to any impurity wherewith he is wont to be polluted, &amp; having forgotten, do know it afterward, he shall be guilty of an offence. The soul that sweareth, and uttereth with his lips that he would do either ill or well, and bindeth the same with an oath, and his word, &amp; having forgotten afterward understandeth his offence, let him do penance for his sin, and offer of the flocks an ewe lamb, or a she goat, and the Priest shall pray for him and for his sin: but if he be not able to offer a beast, let him offer two turtles, or two young pigeons to our Lord, one for sin, and the other for an holocaust, and he shall give them to the Priest: who offering the first for sin, shall writhe back the head thereof to the little pinions, so that it stick to the neck, and be not altogether broken off. And of the blood thereof he shall sprinkle the wall of the altar, and whatsoever is left, he shall make it distill to the bottom thereof, because it is for sin. And the other he shall burn for an holocaust, as is wont to be done: and the Priest shall pray for him, and for his sin, and it shall be forgiven him. And if his hand be not able to offer two turtles, or two young pigeons, he shall offer for his sin of flour the tenth part of an ephi. He shall not put oil upon it, nor cast any frankincense thereon, because it is for sin, and he shall deliver it to the Priest: who taking thereof a full handful, shall burn it upon the altar for a monument of him that did offer it, praying for him &amp; making expiation: but the part that is left, himself shall have for a gift. </div>

If a soul sin by ignorance, and do one of those things which by the law of the Lord are forbidden, and being guilty of sin, understand his iniquity, he shall offer a ram without spot of the flocks to the Priest, according to the measure and estimation of the sin: who shall pray for him, because he did it unwitting: and it shall be forgiven him, because by error he offended against the Lord.</div>
