			<div class='roleText'>And Jacob dwelt in the land of Chanaan, wherein his father sojourned. And these are his generations: Joseph when he was sixteen years old, fed the flock with his brethren being yet a boy: and he was with the sons of Bala and Zelpha his father's wives: and he accused his brethren to his father of a most wicked crime. And Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had begotten him in his old age and he made him a coat of diverse colours. And his brethren seeing that he was loved of his father more than all his sons, they hated him, neither could they speak any thing to him peaceably. It chanced also that he reported to his brethren a dream that he had seen, which occasion was the seed of great hatred. And he said to them: </div>
