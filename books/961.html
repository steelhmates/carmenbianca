			<div class='roleText'>And he turned me to the gate of the house, and behold waters issued forth under the threshold of the house toward the East: for the face of the house looked to the East: but the waters descended into the right side of the temple to the South part of the altar. And he led me out by the way of the North gate, and he turned me to the way without the utter gate, the way that looked to the East: and behold waters flowing on the right side. When the man went out toward the East, that had the cord in his hand, he measured a thousand cubits: and he brought me through the water even to the ankles. And again he measured a thousand, &amp; he brought me through the water even to the knees: and he measured a thousand, and he brought me through the water even to the reins. And he measured a thousand, a torrent which I could not pass over, because the waters were risen of the deep torrent which cannot be passed over. And he said to me: Certes thou hast seen o son of man. And he brought me out, and he turned me to the bank of the torrent. And when I had turned myself, behold in the bank of the torrent exceeding many trees on both sides. And he said to me: These waters, that issue forth toward the heaps of the sand in the East, and descend to the plains of the desert, shall go into the sea, &amp; shall go out, &amp; the waters shall be healed. And every living soul, that creepeth, whither soever the torrent cometh shall live: and there shall be fishes very many after these waters are come thither, and they shall be healed, and all things shall live, to which the torrent shall come. And fishers shall stand over them, from Engaddi even to Engallim shall be drying of nets: there shall be very many sorts of fishes thereof, as the fishes of the great sea, of a passing great multitude: but in the shore thereof, &amp; in the fenny places they shall not be healed, because they shall be turned into salt pits. And over the torrent shall rise in the banks thereof on both sides every tree bearing fruit: the leaf shall not fall from it, &amp; the fruit thereof shall not fail: every month shall it bring forth first fruits, because the waters thereof shall issue out of the sanctuary: &amp; the fruits thereof shall be for meat, &amp; the leaves thereof for medicine. Thus saith our Lord God: This is the border, in which you shall possess the land in the twelve tribes of Israel: because Joseph hath a double cord. and you shall possess it every man in like manner as his brother: upon which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers: and this land shall fall unto you for a possession. And this is the border of the land: toward the North quarter, from the great sea by the way of Hethalon, as they come to Sedada, Emath, Berotha, Sabarim, which is between the border of Damascus and the confine of Emath, the house of Tichon, which is by the border of Auran. And the border from the Sea even to the court of Enon, shall be the border of Damascus, and from the North to the North, the border of Emath the North quarter. Moreover the East quarter from the midst of Auran, and from the midst of Damascus, and from the midst of Galaad, and from the midst of the land of Israel, Jordan making the bound to the East sea, you shall measure also the East quarter. And the South quarter toward the South from Thamar even to the waters of contradiction of Cades: and the torrent even to the great sea: and this is the South quarter toward the South. And the quarter of the Sea, the great sea from the confine directly, till thou come to Emath: this is the quarter of the Sea. And you shall divide this land unto you by the tribes of Israel: and you shall cast it for an inheritance to you, and to the strangers, that shall come to you, that have begotten children in the midst of you: and they shall be unto you as the same country-men born among the children of Israel: they shall divide the possession with you in the midst of the tribes of Israel. And in what tribe soever the stranger shall be, there shall you give him possession, saith our Lord God.</div>
