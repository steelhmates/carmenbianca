			<div class='roleText'>AND Peter and John went up into the temple, at the ninth hour of prayer. And a certain man that was lame from his mother's womb, was carried; whom they laid every day at the gate of the temple, that is called Specious, that he might ask alms of them that went into the temple. He, when he had seen Peter and John about to enter into the temple, asked to receive an alms. But Peter with John looking upon him, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Silver and gold I have not, but that which I have, the same I give to thee: In the name of JESUS CHRIST of Nazareth arise, and walk. And taking his right hand, he lifted him up, and forthwith his feet &amp; soles were made strong. And springing he stood, &amp; walked; &amp; went in with them into the temple walking, and leaping, and praising God. And all the people saw him walking and praising God. And they knew him, that it was he which sat for alms at the Specious gate of the temple: and they were exceedingly astonished and aghast at that that had chanced to him. And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran to them unto the porch which is called Salomon's, wondering. But Peter seeing them, made answer to the people: Ye men of Israel, why marvel you at this, or why look you upon us, as though by our power or holiness we have made this man to walk? The God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers hath glorified his Son JESUS, whom you indeed delivered &amp; denied before the face of Pilate, he judging him to be released. But you denied the Holy and the Just One, and asked a man-killer to be given unto you. But the Author of life you killed, whom God hath raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses. And in the faith of his name, this man whom you see and know, his name hath strengthened; &amp; the faith which is by him, hath given this perfect health in the sight of all you. And now (brethren) I know that you did it through ignorance, as also your princes. But God who foreshewed by the mouth of all the Prophets that his CHRIST should suffer, hath so fulfilled it. Be Penitent therefore &amp; convert, that your sins may be put out. That, when the times shall come of refreshing by the sight of our Lord, and he shall send him that hath been preached unto you JESUS CHRIST. Whom Heaven truly must receive until the times of the restitution of all things, which God spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets from the beginning of the world. Moyses indeed said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>That a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up to you of your brethren, as myself: him you shall hear according to all things whatsoever he shall speak to you. And it shall be, every soul that shall not hear that Prophet, shall be destroyed out of the people. And all the Prophets from Samuel and afterward that have spoken, told of these days. You are the children of the Prophets and of the Testament which God made to our fathers, saying to Abraham: And in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed. To you first God raising up his Son, hath sent him blessing you: that every one should convert himself from his naughtiness.</div>
