			<div class='roleText'>Then Holofernes said to her: Be of good cheer, and fear not in thy heart: because I have never hurt man, that would serve Nabuchodonosor the king. And thy people, if they had not contemned me, I would never have lifted up my spear over them. But now tell me, for what cause hast thou departed from them, and it hath pleased thee to come to us? And Judith said to him: Take the words of thy handmaid, for if thou wilt follow the words of thy handmaid, our Lord will do with thee a perfect thing. For Nabuchodonosor the king of the earth liveth, and his power liveth which is in thee to the chastising of all straying souls: that not only men serve him by thee, but also the beasts of the field obey him. For the industry of thy mind is reported to all nations, and it is declared to all the world, that thou only art good, and mighty in all his Kingdom, and thy discipline is bruited to all provinces. Neither is that unknown which Achior spake, neither are we ignorant of that^ thou hast commanded to come upon him. For it is certain that our God is so offended with sins, that he hath sent word by his Prophets to the people, that he will deliver them for their sins. And because the children of Israel know they offended their God, thy dread is upon them. Moreover also famine hath invaded them, and for drought of water they are now esteemed among the dead. Finally, they ordain this, to kill their cattle, and to drink the blood of them, and the holy things of our Lord their God, which God commanded not to be touched, in corn, wine, and oil, these have they purposed to bestow, and they will consume the things which they ought not to touch with their hands: therefore because they do these things, it is sure that they shall be given in to perdition. Which I thy handmaid knowing, am fled from them, &amp; our Lord hath sent me to tell thee these very things. For I thy handmaid worship God, even now being with thee, and thy handmaid will go forth, and I will pray God, and he will tell me when he will repay them their sins, and I coming will tell thee, so that I may bring thee through the midst of Jerusalem, and thou shalt have all the people of Israel, as sheep that have no pastor, &amp; there shall not so much as one dog bark against thee: because these things are told me by the providence of God. And because God is angry with them, I am sent to tell these very things to thee. And all these words pleased Holofernes, and his servants, and they marveled at her wisdom, and one said to another: There is not such a woman upon the earth in look, in beauty, and in sense of words. And Holofernes said to her: God hath done well, which sent thee before the people, that thou mightest give them into our hands: and because thy promise is good, if thy God shall do this for me, he shall also be my God, and thou shalt be great in the house of Nabuchodonosor, and thy name shall be renowned in all the earth.</div>
