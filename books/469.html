			<div class='roleText'>And this was the copy of the letter. The most great king Artaxerxes from India unto Aethiopia, to the Princes of an hundred and seven &amp; twenty provinces, and to the captains that are subject to his empire, greeting. Whereas I reigned over many nations, and had subdued all the world to my dominion, I would not abuse the greatness of my might, but with clemency &amp; lenity govern my subjects, that passing their life quietly without any terror, they might enjoy peace wished of all men. But when I demanded of my counsellers how this might be accomplished, one that excelled the rest in wisdom &amp; fidelity, &amp; was second after the king, Aman by name, told me that there was a people dispersed through the whole world, which used new laws, and doing against the customs of all Nations, contemned the commandments of kings, and brake the concord of all nations by their dissension. Which when we had learned, seeing one nation rebellious against all kind of men to use perverse laws, &amp; to go against our commandments, and to disturb the peace and concord of the Provinces subject to us, we have commanded that whomsoever Aman shall shew, who is chief over all the Provinces, and second after the king, and whom we honour in stead of a father, they with their wives and children be destroyed of their enemies, and that none have pity on them the fourteenth day of the twelfth month Adar of this present year: that the wicked men going down to hell in one day, may restore the peace to our empire, which they had disturbed.

Thou madest heaven and earth, and whatsoever is contained in the compass of heaven. Thou art Lord of all, neither is there that can resist thy majesty. Thou understandest all things, and knowest that I have not done this for pride and contumely, and any desire of glory, that I adored not the proud Aman, (for gladly would I be ready for the salvation of Israel to kiss even the steps of his feet,) but I feared lest I should transfer the honour of my God to a man, and lest I should adore any except my God. And now o Lord King, the God of Abraham have mercy upon thy people, because our enemies will destroy us, and extinguish thine inheritance. Despise not thy portion, which thou hast redeemed to thyself out of Aegypt. Hear my prayer, and be propitious to thy lot and cord, and turn our mourning into joy, that living we may praise thy name o Lord, and do not shut the mouths of them that sing to thee. All Israel also with like mind and supplication cried to our Lord, because certain death did hang over them.</div>
