			<div class='roleText'>Arise, go thou and thy house, and sojourn wheresoever thou shalt find: for our Lord hath called a famine, and it shall come upon the land seven years. Who arose, and did according to the word of the man of God: and going with her household, she sojourned in the land of the Philisthiims many days. And when the seven years were ended, the woman returned out of the Land of the Philisthiims: and she went forth to speak to the king for her house, and for her lands. And the king spake with Giezi the servant of the man of God, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord hath shewed me that thou shalt be king of Syria. Who when he was departed from Eliseus, came to his master, who said to him: What said Eliseus to thee? But he answered: He told me: Thou shalt recover health. And when the next day was come, he took a coverlet, and poured water thereon, and spread it upon his face: who being dead, Hazael reigned for him. In the fifth year of Joram the son of Achab the king of Israel, and of Josaphat the king of Juda, reigned Joram the son of Josaphat the king of Juda. He was two and thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem. And he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, as the house of Achab had walked: for the daughter of Achab was his wife: and he did that which is evil in the sight of our Lord. But our Lord would not destroy Juda, for David his servant, as he had promised him, to give him a lamp to him, &amp; to his children always. In his days revolted Edom, from being under Juda, and made to it-self a king. And Joram came to Seira, and all the chariots with him: and he arose in the night, and struck the Idumeans, that had beset him, and the captains of the chariots, and the people fled into their tabernacles. Edom therefore revolted from being under Juda, until this day. Then Lobna also revolted at that time. But the rest of the words of Joram, and all that he did, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the kings of Juda? And Joram slept with his fathers, and was buried with them in the city of David, and Ochozias his son reigned for him. In the twelfth year of Joram the son of Achab the king of Israel, reigned Ochozias the son of Joram the king of Juda. Two and twenty years old was Ochozias when he began to reign, and he reigned one year in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Athalia the daughter of Amri the king of Israel. And he walked in the ways of the house of Achab: &amp; he did that which is evil before our Lord, as the house of Achab: for he was the son in law of the house of Achab. He went also with Joram the son of Achab, to fight against Hazael the king of Syria in Ramoth Galaad, and the Syrians wounded Joram. Who returned to be cured in Jezrahel: because the Syrians wounded him in Ramoth fighting against Hazael the king of Syria. Moreover Ochozias the son of Joram the king of Juda went down to visit Joram the son of Achab into Jezrael, because he was sick there.</div>
