			<div class='roleText'>PAUL an Apostle of JESUS Christ according to the commandment of God our Saviour, and of Christ JESUS our hope: To Timothee his beloved son in the faith. Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father, and from Christ JESUS our Lord. As I desired thee to remain at Ephesus when I went into Macedonia, that thou shouldest denounce to certain not to teach otherwise, nor to attend to fables and genealogies having no end: which minister questions rather than the edifying of God which is in faith. But the end of the precept is charity from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and a faith not feigned. From the which things certain straying, are turned into vain-talk, desirous to be doctors of the Law, not understanding neither what things they speak, nor of what they affirm. But we know that the Law is good, if a man use it lawfully: knowing this, that the Law is not made to the just man, but to the unjust, &amp; disobedient, to the impious &amp; sinners, to the wicked &amp; contaminate, to killers of fathers &amp; killers of mothers, to murderers, to fornicators, to liers with mankind, to man-stealers, to liars, to perjured persons, and what other thing soever is contrary to sound doctrine, which is according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which is committed to me. I give him thanks which hath strengthened me, Christ JESUS our Lord, because he hath esteemed me faithful, putting me in the ministry. Who before was blasphemous and a persecutor and contumelious. But I obtained the mercy of God, because I did it being ignorant in incredulity. And the grace of our Lord over-abounded with faith and love, which is in Christ JESUS. A faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Christ JESUS came into this world to save sinners, of whom I am the chief. But therefore have I obtained mercy: that in me first of all^ Christ JESUS might shew all patience, to the information of them that shall believe on him unto life everlasting. And to the King of the worlds, immortal, invisible, only God, honour &amp; glory for ever and ever. Amen. This precept I commend to thee, o Timothee: according to the prophecies going before on thee, that thou war in them a good warfare, having faith and a good conscience, which certain repelling have made shipwreck about the faith. Of whom is Hymenaeus &amp; Alexander: whom I have delivered to Satan, that they may learn not to blaspheme.</div>
