			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm to Asaph. The God of gods our Lord hath spoken: and he hath called the earth, from the rising of the sun even to the going down. Out of Sion the beauty of his comeliness. God will come manifestly: our God and he will not keep silence. Fire shall burn forth in his sight: and round about him a mighty tempest. He shall call the heaven from above: and the earth to discern his people. Gather ye together his Saints unto him: which ordain his testament above sacrifices. And the heavens shall shew forth his justice: because God is Judge. Hear, o my people, and I will speak: Israel, and I will testify to thee: God thy God am I. I will not rebuke thee in thy sacrifices: and thy holocausts are in my sight always. I will not take calves out of thy house: nor buck-goats out of thy flocks. Because all the wild beasts of the woods be mine, the cattle in the mountains and oxen. I have known all the fowls of the air: and the beauty of the field is with me. If I shall be hungry, I will not tell thee: for the round earth is mine, and the fullness thereof. Will I eat the flesh of oxen? Or will I drink the blood of buck-goats? Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise, and pay thy vows to the Highest. And invocate me in the day of tribulation: I will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify me. But to the sinner God hath said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why doest thou declare my justices, and takest my testament by thy mouth? But thou hast hated discipline &amp; cast my words behind thee. If thou didst see a thief, thou didst run with him: and with adulterers thou didst put thy portion. Thy mouth hath abounded with malice: and thy tongue forged guiles. Sitting thou spakest against thy brother, and against thy mother's son thou didst put a scandal: these things hast thou done, and I have held my peace. Thou hast thought unjustly that I will be like thee: I will reprove thee, and set it against thy face. Understand these things you that forget God: lest sometime he take you violently and there be none to deliver you. The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me: and there is the way, by which I will shew him the salvation of God.</div>
