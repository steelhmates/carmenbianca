			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. I believed, for which cause I spake: but I was humbled exceedingly. I said in mine excess: Every man is a liar. What shall I render to our Lord, for all things that he hath rendered to me? I will take the chalice of salvation: and I will invocate the name of our Lord. I will render my vows to our Lord before all his people: precious in the sight of our Lord is the death of his Saints. O Lord because I am thy servant: I am thy servant, and the son of thy handmaid. Thou hast broken my bonds: I will sacrifice to thee the host of praise, and I will invocate the name of our Lord. I will render my vows to our Lord in the sight of all his people: in the courts of the house of our Lord, in the midst of thee, o Jerusalem.</div>
