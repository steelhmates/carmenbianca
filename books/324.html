			<div class='roleText'>But Athalia the mother of Ochozias seeing her son dead, arose, and slew all the king's seed. But Josaba king Joram's daughter, the sister of Ochozias, taking Joas the son of Ochozias, stole him out of the midst of the king's children, that were slain, and his nurse out of the bed chamber: and hid him from the face of Athalia, that he should not be slain. And he was with her six years secretly in the house of our Lord. Moreover Athalia reigned over the land. And in the seventh year Joiada sent and taking the centurions and the soldiers brought them in to him into the temple of our Lord, and made a covenant with them: and adjuring them in the house of our Lord, shewed them the king's son: and commanded them, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This is the thing, which you must do. Let the third part of you go in on the Sabbath, and keep the watch of the king's house. And let a third part be at the gate Sur: and let a third part be at the gate behind the dwelling of the shieldbearers: and you shall keep the watch of the house of Messa. But let two parts of you all that go forth on the Sabbath, keep the watch of the house of our Lord about the king. And you shall guard him round about, having weapons in your hands: and if any man shall enter the precinct of the temple, let him be slain: and you shall be with the king coming in and going out. And the centurions did according to all things, that Joiada the Priest had commanded them: and every one taking their men, that went in on the Sabbath, with them that went out in the Sabbath, came to Joiada the Priest. Who gave them the spears, and the weapons of king David, which were in the house of our Lord. And they stood every one having their weapons in their hand, on the right side of the temple, unto the left side of the altar, and of the temple, about the king. And he brought forth the king's son, and put upon him the diadem, and the covenant: and they made him king, and anointed him: and clapping with the hand, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>God save the king. And Athalia heard the voice of people running: and she going into the multitudes into the temple of our Lord, saw the king standing upon the tribunal seat according to the manner, and the singers, and trumpets near him, and all the people of the land rejoicing, and sounding the trumpets: and she rent her garments, and cried: A conspiracy, a conspiracy. But Joiada commanded the centurions, that were over the army, and said to them: Lead her forth without the precinct of the temple, and whosoever shall follow her, let him be strucken with the sword. For the Priest had said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let her not be slain in the temple of our Lord. And they laid hands on her: and threw her by the way of the entrance of the horses, beside the palace, and she was slain there. Joiada therefore made a covenant between our Lord, and the king, and between the people, that it should be the people of our Lord, and between the king and the people. And all the people of the land entered into the temple of Baal, and destroyed his altars, and his images they brake in pieces stoutly: Mathan also the priest of Baal they slew before the altar. And the priest set guards in the house of our Lord. And he took the centurions, and the legions of Cerethi and Phelethi, and all the people of the land, and they brought the king from the house of our Lord: and they came by the way of the gate of the shieldbearers into the palace, and he sat upon the throne of the kings. And all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was quiet: but Athalia was slain with the sword in the king's house. And Joas was seven years old, when he began to reign.</div>
