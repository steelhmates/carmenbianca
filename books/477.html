			<div class='roleText'>Call therefore if there be that will answer thee, and turn to some of the Saints. Anger indeed killeth the foolish, and envy slayeth the little one. I have seen a fool with firm root, and I cursed his beauty by and by. His children shall be made far from salvation, and shall be destroyed in the gate, and there shall be none to deliver. Whose harvest the hungry shall eat, and the armed shall take him by violence, and the thirsty shall drink his riches. Nothing in the earth is done without a cause, and out of the ground sorrow shall not rise. Man is born to labour, and the bird to flight. For the which thing I will beseech our Lord, and toward God I will set my speech: Who doeth great and unsearchable and marvelous things without number: Who giveth rain upon the face of the earth, and watereth all things with waters: Who setteth the humble on high, and them that are in heaviness he comforteth with health: Who dissipateth the cogitations of the malignant, that their hands cannot accomplish that which they began: Who apprehendeth the wise in their subtilty, and dissipateth the counsel of the wicked: By day they shall incur darkness, and as it were in the night, so shall they grope at noon days. Moreover he shall save the needy from the sword of their mouth, and the poor from the hand of the violent. And to the needy there shall be hope, but iniquity shall draw together her mouth. Blessed is the man that is corrected of God: refuse not therefore the chastising of our Lord: Because he woundeth, and cureth: striketh, &amp; his hands shall heal. In six tribulations he shall deliver thee, and in the seventh evil shall not touch thee. In famine he shall deliver thee from death, and in battle, from the hand of the sword. From the scourge of the tongue thou shalt be hid; and thou shalt not fear calamity when it cometh. In waste and famine thou shalt laugh, &amp; the beasts of the earth thou shalt not fear. But with the stones of the lands thy covenant, and the beasts of the earth shall be peaceable to thee. And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle hath peace, and visiting thy beauty, thou shalt not sin. Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be manifold, and thy progeny as the grass of the earth. Thou shalt enter into the grave in aboundance, as a heap of wheat is carried in his time. Behold, this is even so, as we have searched out: which thou having heard revolve in thy mind.</div>
