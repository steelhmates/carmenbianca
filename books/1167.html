			<div class='roleText'>AND when they were speaking to the people, the Priests and Magistrates of the temple &amp; the Sadducees came upon them, being grieved that they taught the people, and shewed in JESUS the resurrection from the dead: and they laid hands upon them, and put them into ward, until the morrow, for it was now evening. And many of them that had heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was made five thousand. And it came to pass on the morrow, that their princes, and Ancients, and Scribes were gathered into Jerusalem. And Annas the high Priest, and Caiphas and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the priest's stock. And setting them in the midst, they asked: In what power or in what name have you done this? Then Peter replenished with the Holy Ghost, said to them: Ye princes of the people and Ancients: If we^ this day be examined for a good deed upon an impotent man, in what he hath been made whole, be it known to all you and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of JESUS CHRIST of Nazareth, whom you did crucify, whom God hath raised from the dead, in this same this man standeth before you whole. This is the stone that was rejected of you the builders: which is made into the head of the corner: and there is not salvation in any other. For neither is there any other name under Heaven given to men, wherein we must be saved. And seeing Peter's constancy and John's, understanding that they were men unlettered, and of the vulgar sort, they marveled; and they knew them that they had been with JESUS: seeing the man also that had been cured, standing with them, they could say nothing to the contrary, But they commanded them to go aside forth out of the council: and they conferred together, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What shall we do to these men? for a notorious sign indeed hath been done by them, to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: it is manifest, and we cannot deny it. But that it be no further spread abroad among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak no more in this name to any man. And calling them, they charged them that they should not speak at all, nor teach in the name of JESUS. But Peter and John answering, said to them: If it be just in the sight of God, to hear you rather than God, judge ye. For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard. But they threatening, dismissed them: not finding how they might punish them, for the people, because all glorified that which had been done, in that which was chanced. For the man was more than forty years old in whom that sign of health had been wrought. And being dismissed they came to theirs, and shewed all that the chief priests and Ancients had said to them. Who having heard it, with one accord lifted up their voice to God, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why did the Gentiles rage, and the people meditate vain things: the kings of the earth stand up, and the Princes assemble together against our Lord, and against his CHRIST? For there assembled indeed in this city against the holy child JESUS whom thou hast anointed, Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel; to do what thy hand and thy counsel decreed to be done. And now Lord look upon their threatenings, and give unto thy servants with all confidence to speak thy word, in that, that thou extend thy hand to cures &amp; signs and wonders to be done by the name of thy holy son JESUS. And when they had prayed, the place was moved wherein they were gathered: and they were all replenished with the Holy Ghost, and they spake the word of God with confidence. And the multitude of believers had one heart and one soul: neither did any one say that ought was his own of those things which he possessed, but all things were common unto them. And with great power did the Apostles give testimony of the resurrection of JESUS CHRIST our Lord: and great grace was in all them. For neither was there any one needy among them. For as many as were owners of lands or houses, sold and brought the prices of those things which they sold, and laid it before the feet of the Apostles. And to every one was divided according as every one had need. And Joseph who was surnamed of the Apostles Barnabas (which is by interpretation, the son of consolation) a Levite, a Cyprian born, whereas he had a piece of land, sold it, and brought the price, and laid it before the feet of the Apostles.</div>
