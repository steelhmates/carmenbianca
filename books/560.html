			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for the sons of Core. All ye Nations clap hands: make jubilation to God in the voice of exultation. Because our Lord is high, terrible: a great King over all the earth. He hath made peoples subject to us: &amp; gentiles under our feet. He hath chosen his inheritance in us: the beauty of Jacob which he loved. God is ascended in jubilation: and our Lord in the voice of trumpet. Sing ye to our God, sing ye: Sing ye to our King, sing ye. Because God is King of all the earth: sing ye wisely. God shall reign over the gentiles: God sitteth upon his holy seat. Princes of peoples are gathered together with the God of Abraham: because the strong gods of the earth are exceedingly advanced.</div>
