			<div class='roleText'>And when these things had been ritely celebrated, all Israel that was found in the cities of Juda, went forth, and they brake the idols, &amp; cut down the groves, overthrew the excelses, and destroyed the altars, not only out of all Juda and Benjamin, but out of Ephraim also and Manasses, till they utterly destroyed them: and all the children of Israel returned into their possessions and cities. And Ezechias appointed companies of Priests, and of Levites, by their divisions, every man in his own office, to wit, as well of the Priests, as of the Levites, for the holocausts, and pacifics, that they should minister, and confess, and sing in the gates of the camp of our Lord. And the king's part was, that of his proper substance^ holocaust should be offered, morning always and evening, in the Sabbaths also, and the Calends, and in other solemnities, as it is written in the law of Moyses. He commanded also the people that dwelt in Jerusalem, to give portions to the Priests, and the Levites, that they might attend the law of our Lord. Which when it was noised in the ears of the multitude, the children of Israel offered very many first fruits of corn, of wine, and of oil, of honey also: and of all things, which the ground bringeth forth, they offered tithes. Yea and the children of Israel and Juda, that dwelt in the cities of Juda, offered tithes of oxen, and sheep, and tithes of sanctified things, which they had vowed to our Lord their God: and carrying them all, made many heaps. The third month they began to lay the foundations of the heaps, and in the seventh month they finished them. And when Ezechias and his Princes came in, they saw the heaps, and blessed our Lord, and the people of Israel. And Ezechias asked the Priests and the Levites, why the heaps lay so: Azarias the high Priest of the stock of Sadoc answered him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Since first fruits began to be offered in the house of our Lord, we have eaten, and have been full, and very much hath remained, because our Lord hath blessed his people: and of the remains this is the aboundance, which thou seest. Ezechias therefore commanded that storehouses should be prepared in the house of our Lord. Which when they had done, they brought in as well the first fruits, as the tithes, and whatsoever they had vowed, faithfully. And the overseer of them was Chonenias a Levite, &amp; Semei his brother the second, after whom Jahiel, and Azarias, and Nahath, and Asael, and Jerimoth, Josabad also, and Eliel, and Iesmachias, and Mahath, and Banaias, overseers under the hand of Chonenias, and Semei his brother, by the commandment of Ezechias the king, and Azarias the high Priest of the house of God, to whom all things appertained. But Core the son of Jemna a Levite, and porter of the east gate, was overseer of those things, which were voluntarily offered to our Lord, and of the first fruits and the things consecrated for Sancta sanctorum. And under his charge Eden, and Benjamin, Jesue, and Semeias, Amarias also, and Sechenias, in the cities of the Priests, that they should faithfully distribute to their brethren portions, to the lesser and greater: saving the men children from three years and above, to all that entered into the temple of our Lord, and whatsoever day by day was profitable in the ministry, and the observances according to their divisions, to the Priests by families, and to the Levites from the twentieth year and upward, by the orders and companies, and to all the multitude, as well their wives, as their children of both sex, meats were given faithfully of these things, that had been sanctified. Yea and of the children of Aaron by the fields and the suburbs of every city, there were men ordained, that should distribute portions, to all the male sex, of the Priests and the Levites. Ezechias therefore did all things which we have said in all Juda: and wrought good and right, and truth before our Lord his God, in all the service of the ministry of the house of our Lord, according to the law and the ceremonies, willing to seek his God in all his heart, and he did it and prospered.</div>
