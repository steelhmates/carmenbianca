			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. From the depths I have cried to thee, o Lord: Lord hear my voice: Let thine ears be intent to the voice of my petition. If thou shalt observe iniquities, o Lord: Lord who shall sustain it? Because with thee there is propitiation: and for thy law I have expected thee, o Lord. My soul hath expected in his word: my soul hath hoped in our Lord. From the morning watch even until night: let Israel hope in our Lord. Because with our Lord there is mercy: and with him plenteous redemption. And he shall redeem Israel, from all his iniquities.</div>
