			<div class='roleText'>In those days Ezechias was sick even to death: &amp; Isaie the son of Amos the prophet came and said to him: Thus saith our Lord God: Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and shalt not live. Who turned his face to the wall, and prayed our Lord, saying: I beseech thee Lord, remember I pray thee how I have walked before thee in truth, and in a perfect heart, and have done that which is liked before thee. Ezechias therefore wept with great weeping. And before Isaie was gone out of the midst of the court, the word of our Lord came to him, saying: Return, and tell Ezechias the Prince of my people: Thus saith our Lord the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, and seen thy tears: and behold I have healed thee, the third day thou shalt go up to the temple of the Lord. And I will add to thy days fifteen years: yea &amp; out of the hand of the king of Assyrians I will deliver thee, and this city, and I will protect this city for my sake, and for David my servant. And Isaie said: </div>

And Ezechias had said to Isaie: What sign shall there be, that our Lord will heal me, and that I shall go up the third day to the temple of our Lord? To whom Isaie said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This shall be the sign from our Lord, that our Lord will do the word, which he hath spoken: Wilt thou that the shadow go forward ten times, or that it go back so many degrees. And Ezechias said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>It is an easy matter for the shadow to go forward ten times, neither will I that this be done, but that it return back ten degrees. Isaie therefore the Prophet invocated our Lord, &amp; brought back the shadow by the lines, by the which it was now gone down in the dial of Achaz, backward ten degrees. In that time Berodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of the Babylonians sent letters &amp; gifts to Ezechias: for he had heard that Ezechias had been sick. And Ezechias rejoiced in their coming, and he shewed them the house of aromatical spices, and gold and silver, and diverse precious odours, ointments also, and the house of his vessels, and all that he had in his treasures. There was not any thing which Ezechias shewed them not in his house, and in all his power. And Isaie the Prophet came to king Ezechias, and said to him: What said these men? Or from whence came they to thee? To whom Ezechias said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>From a far country they came to me out of Babylon. But he answered: What saw they in thy house? Ezechias said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>They saw all things whatsoever are in my house: there is nothing that I have not shewed them in my treasures. Isaie therefore said to Ezechias, hear the word of our Lord: Behold the days shall come, and all things shall be taken away, that are in thy house, and that thy fathers have laid up until this day, into Babylon: there shall not any thing remain, saith our Lord. Yea of the children also that come forth of thee, whom thou shalt beget shall be taken away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. Ezechias said to Isaie: The word of our Lord which thou hast spoken is good: be there peace and truth in my days. But the rest of the words of Ezechias, and all his strength, and how he made a pool, &amp; a conduit, &amp; brought waters into the city, are not these things written in the Book of the words of the days of the kings of Juda? And Ezechias slept with his fathers, and Manasses his son reigned for him.</div>
