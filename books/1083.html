			<div class='roleText'>AND entering into a boat, he passed over the water, and came into his own city. And behold they brought to him one sick of the palsy lying in bed. And JESUS seeing their faith, said to the sick of the palsy: Have a good heart son, thy sins are forgiven thee. And behold certain of the Scribes said within themselves: He blasphemeth. And JESUS seeing their thoughts, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Wherefore think you evil in your hearts? Whether is easier, to say, thy sins are forgiven thee: or to say, arise and walk. But that you may know that the Son of man hath power in earth to forgive sins, (then said he to the sick of the palsy,) Arise, take up thy bed, and go into thy house. And he arose, and went into his house. And the multitudes seeing it, were afraid, and glorified God that gave such power to men. And when JESUS passed forth from thence, he saw a man sitting in the custom-house, named Matthew; And he saith to him: Follow me. And he arose up, and followed him. And it came to pass as he was sitting at meat in the house, behold many Publicans and sinners came, and sat down with JESUS and his Disciples. And the Pharisees seeing it, said to his disciples: why doth your master eat with Publicans and sinners? But JESUS hearing it, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but thy Disciples do not fast? And JESUS said to them: Can the children of the Bridegroom mourn, as long as the Bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the Bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast. And nobody putteth a piece of raw cloth to an old garment. For he taketh away the piecing thereof from the garment, and there is made a greater rent. Neither do they put new wine into old bottles. Otherwise the bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish. But new wine they put into new bottles: and both are preserved together. As he was speaking this unto them, behold a certain Governor approached, and adored him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Lord, my daughter is even now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live. And JESUS rising up followed him, and his Disciples. And behold a woman which was troubled with an issue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment. For she said within herself: If I shall touch only his garment, I shall be safe. But JESUS turning and seeing her, said: </div>

And this bruit went forth into all that country. And as JESUS passed forth from thence, there followed him two blind men crying and saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>In the prince of devils he casteth out devils. And JESUS went about all the cities, and towns, teaching in their Synagogues, and preaching the Gospel of the Kingdom, and curing every disease, and every infirmity. And seeing the multitudes, he pitied them; because they were vexed, and lay like sheep that have not a shepherd. Then he saith to his Disciples: The harvest surely is great, but the workmen are few. Pray therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he send forth workmen into his harvest.</div>
