			<div class='roleText'>THESE things have I spoken to you, that you be not scandalized. Out of the Synagogues they will cast you: but the hour cometh, that every one which killeth you, shall think that he doeth service to God. And these things they will do to you, because they have not known the Father, nor me. But these things I have spoken to you: that when the hour shall come, you may remember them, that I told you. But I told you not these things from the beginning, because I was with you. And now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asketh me: Whither goest thou? But because I have spoken these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart. But I tell you the truth, it is expedient for you that I go. For if I go not, the Paraclete shall not come to you: but if I go, I will send him to you. And when he is come, he shall argue the world of sin, and of justice, and of judgement. Of sin: because they believed not in me. But of justice: because I go to the Father; and now you shall not see me. And of judgement: because the Prince of this world is now judged. Yet many things I have to say to you: but you cannot bear them now. But when he, the Spirit of truth, cometh, he shall teach you all truth. For he shall not speak of himself; but what things soever he shall hear, he shall speak: and the things that are to come he shall shew you. He shall glorify me; because he shall receive of mine, and shall shew to you. All things whatsoever the Father hath, be mine. Therefore I said, that he shall receive of mine, and shall shew to you. A little while, and now you shall not see me; &amp; again a little while, &amp; you shall see me: because I go to the Father. Some therefore of his Disciples said one to another: What is this that he saith to us: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while and you shall see me, and, because I go to the Father? They said therefore: What is this that he saith, A little while? we know not what he speaketh. And JESUS knew, that they would ask him; &amp; he said to them: Of this you do question among yourselves, because I said to you: A little while, and you shall not see me; and again a little while, and you shall see me. Amen, amen I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice: and you shall be made sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy. A woman when she travaileth, hath sorrow, because her hour is come: but when she hath brought forth the child, now she remembereth not the anguish for joy, that a man is born into the world. And you therefore, now indeed you have sorrow, but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice; and your joy no man shall take from you. And in that day^ me you shall not ask any thing. Amen, amen I say to you, if you ask the Father any thing in my name, he will give it you. Until now you have not asked any thing in my name. Ask and you shall receive; that your joy may be full. These things in proverbs I have spoken to you. The hour cometh when in proverbs I will no more speak to you, but plainly of the Father I will shew you. In that day you shall ask in my name: and I say not to you, that I will ask the Father for you. For the Father himself loveth you, because you have loved me, and have believed that I came forth from God. I came forth from the Father, and came into the world: again I leave the world, and I go to the Father. His Disciples say to him: Behold now thou speakest plainly, and sayest no proverb. Now we know that thou knowest all things, and thou needest not that any man ask thee. In this we believe that thou camest forth from God. JESUS answered them: Now do you believe? Behold the hour cometh, and it is now come, that you shall be scattered every man into his own, and me you shall leave alone: and I am not alone because the Father is with me. These things I have spoken to you, that in me you may have peace. In the world you shall have distress, but have confidence, I have overcome the world.</div>
