			<div class='roleText'>Woe to them that make wicked laws: and writing, have written injustice. That they might oppress the poor in judgement, &amp; do violence to the cause of the humble of my people: that widows might be their prey, and they might spoil pupils. What will you do in the day, of visitation &amp; of calamity coming from far? To whose help will ye fly? And where will ye leave your glory? That you be not bowed under the bond, and fall with the slain? In all these things his fury is not turned away, but his hand is yet stretched forth. Woe to Assur, he is the rod of my fury, &amp; the staff: mine indignation is in their hands. I will send him to a deceitful nation, &amp; will give him commandment against the people of my fury, that he take away spoils, and catch the prey, and put them to be trodden upon, as the mire of the streets. But he shall not so think, and his heart shall not esteem it so: but his heart shall be set to destroy, and to the destruction of no few nations. For he shall say: Are not my princes with all kings? Is not as Charcamis, so Calano: and as Arphad, so Emath? Is not as Damascus, so Samaria? Even as my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idol, so also their idols of Jerusalem, &amp; of Samaria. Shall I not as I have done to Samaria and her idols so do to Jerusalem and her idols? And it shall be: when the Lord shall have accomplished all his works in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, I will visit over the fruit of the magnifical heart of the king of Assur, and over the glory of the haughtiness of his eyes. For he hath said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>In the strength of mine own hand have I done it, and in mine own wisdom have I understood: and I have taken away the borders of peoples, and have spoiled their princes, and have pulled down as a mighty man, them that sat on high. And my hand hath found the strength of peoples as a nest: and as eggs be gathered that are left, so have I gathered together all the earth: and there was none that moved wing, and opened mouth, and once muttered. Shall the axe glory against him, that cutteth with it? Or shall the saw exalt itself against him, by whom it is drawn? As if a rod should lift up itself against him, that lifteth it up, and a staff exalt itself, which is certes but wood. For this cause the Dominatour the Lord of hosts shall send leanness in his fat ones: and under his glory shall burn as it were the burning of fire kindled. And the light of Israel shall be in fire, and the Holy one thereof in flame: and his thorn shall be kindled, and be devoured, and the briers in one day. And the glory of his forest, and of his carmelus shall be consumed, from the soul even to the flesh, and he shall be a fugitive for fear. And the remains of the wood of his forest, for the fewness shall be numbered, and a child shall write them. And it shall be in that day, the residue of Israel, and they that shall escape of the house of Jacob, shall not add to lean upon him, that striketh them: but they shall lean upon our Lord the holy one of Israel in truth. The remnant shall be converted, the remnant I say of Jacob, to the strong God. For if thy people o Israel shall be as the sand of the sea, the remnant thereof shall be converted, consummation abridged shall make justice overflow. For our Lord the God of hosts shall make consummation, and abridgment in the midst of all the earth. For this cause, thus saith our Lord the God of hosts: O my people inhabiter of Sion, be not afraid of Assur: he shall strike thee with his rod, and shall lift up his staff over thee in the way of Aegypt. For yet a little, and a very little, &amp; mine indignation and fury upon their wickedness shall be consummate. And the Lord of hosts shall raise up a scourge upon him, according to the plague of Madian in the Rock Oreb, and his rod upon the sea, and he shall lift it up in the way of Aegypt. And it shall be in that day: his burden shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy neck, and the yoke shall putrefy at the face of oil. He shall come into Aiath, he shall pass into Magron: at Machmas he shall commend his vessels. They have passed in haste, Gaba is our seat: Rama was astonished, Gabaath of Saul fled. Neigh with thy voice o daughter of Gallim, attend Laisa, seely poor Anathoth. Medemena is removed: Ye inhabitants of Gabin take courage. Yet there is day, to stand in Nobe: he shall shake his hand over the mountain of the daughter of Sion, the little hill of Jerusalem. Behold the dominatour the Lord of hosts shall break the little flagon in terror, and the high of stature shall be cut down, and the lofty shall be humbled. And the thick places of the forest shall be overthrown with iron, and Libanus with the high ones shall fall.</div>
