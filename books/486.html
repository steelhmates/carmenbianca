			<div class='roleText'>Man born of woman, living a short time, is replenished with many miseries. Who as a flower cometh forth and is destroyed, and flyeth as a shadow, and never abideth in the same state. And doest thou count it a worthy thing to open thine eyes upon such an one, and to bring him with thee into judgment? Who can make clean him that is conceived of unclean seed? Is it not thou which only art? The days of man are short, and the number of his months is with thee, thou hast appointed his limits which cannot be passed. Depart a little from him, that he may rest, until his day wished for come, even as the hired man's. A tree hath hope: if it be cut, it waxeth green again, and the boughs thereof spring. If his root be old in the earth, and the trunk thereof be dead in the dust, At the scent of water it shall spring, and bring forth leaves, as when it was first planted. But when man shall be dead, and naked, and consumed, where is he I pray? As if the waters should depart out of the sea, and a river made empty should be dried up. So man when he is asleep shall not rise again, till heaven perish, he shall not awake, nor rise up out of his sleep. Who will grant me this, that in hell thou protect me, and hide me till thy fury pass, and appoint me a time, wherein thou wilt remember me? Shall man that is dead, thinkest thou, live again? All the days, in which I am now in warfare, I expect until my change do come. Thou shalt call me, and I shall answer thee: to the work of thy hands thou shalt reach thy right hand. Thou indeed hast numbered my steps: but thou wilt spare my sins. Thou hast sealed my offences as it were in a bag, but hast cured mine iniquity. A mountain falling slideth down, and a rock is removed out of his place. Waters make stones hollow, and with inundation the earth by little and little is consumed: and men therefore thou shalt destroy in like manner. Thou hast strengthened him a little, that he might pass away for ever: thou shalt change his face, and shalt send him forth. Whether his children shall be noble, or unnoble, he shall not understand. But yet his flesh whilst he shall live shall have sorrow, and his soul shall mourn upon himself.</div>
