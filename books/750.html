			<div class='roleText'>Rejoice not in impious children, if they be multiplied: neither be delighted upon them, if the fear of God be not in them. Credit not their life, and respect not their labours. For better is one fearing God, than a thousand impious children. And it is more profitable to die without children, rather than to leave impious children. By one wise a country shall be inhabited, and the tribe of the impious shall be made desolate. Many such things hath mine eye seen, and mine ear hath heard things of more force than these. In the synagogue of sinners a fire shall flame, and in an incredulous nation wrath shall wax hot. The old giants did not obtain for their sins, who were destroyed trusting to their own strength: and he spared not the peregrination of Lot, and he detested them for the pride of their word. He had not pity on them, destroying the whole nation, and extolling themselves in their sins. And as the six hundred thousand foot men, which were gathered together in the hardness of their heart: and if one had been stiff necked, it is marvel if he had been unpunished. For there is mercy and wrath with him. Mighty exoration, &amp; pouring out wrath: according to his mercy, so his chastisement judgeth a man according to his works. The sinner shall not escape in robbery, and the sufferance of him that doth mercy shall not slack. All mercy shall make a place to every man according to the merit of his works, &amp; according to the understanding of his peregrination. Say not: I shall be hid from God, and from on high who shall remember me? In a great people I shall not be known: for what is my soul among so innumerable creatures? Behold heaven, and the heavens of heavens, the depth, and all the earth, &amp; the things that are in them, in his sight shall be moved, the mountains together, and the little hills, &amp; the foundations of the earth: &amp; when God shall behold them, they shall be shaken with trembling. And in all these things the heart is senseless: and every heart is understood of him: and his ways who doth understand, and the storm, which neither the eye of man shall see? For many of his works are in secrets: but the works of his justice who shall declare? Or who shall sustain? For the testament is far from some, and the examination of all is in consummation. He that is less of heart, thinketh vain things: and the unwise, and erring man, thinketh foolish things. Hear me my son, and learn the discipline of understanding, and attend to my words in thy heart, and I will speak discipline in equity, and will search to declare wisdom: and to my words attend in thy heart, and I speak in equity of spirit the virtues, that God hath put upon his works from the beginning, and in truth I shew forth his knowledge. In the judgement of God are his works from the beginning, and from the institution of them he distinguished their parts, and their beginnings in their nations. He adorned their works for ever, neither have they hungered, nor laboured, and they have not ceased from their works. Every one shall not vex his neighbour for ever. Be not incredulous to his word. After this God looked upon the earth, &amp; filled it with his good things. And the soul of every living thing shall shew before the face thereof, and into it again is their return.</div>
