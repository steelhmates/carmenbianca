			<div class='roleText'>ADMONISH them to be subject to Princes and Potestates, to obey at a word, to be ready to every good work, to blaspheme no man, not to be litigious, but modest: shewing all mildness toward all men. For we also were sometime unwise, incredulous, erring, serving diverse desires and voluptuousnesses, living in malice and envy, odible, hating one another. But when the benignity and kindness toward man of our Saviour God appeared: not by the works of Justice which we did, but according to his mercy he hath saved us by the laver of regeneration and renovation of the Holy Ghost, whom he hath poured upon us aboundantly by JESUS Christ our Saviour: that being justified by his grace, we may be heirs according to hope of life everlasting. It is a faithful saying, and of these things I will have thee avouch earnestly: that they which believe in God, be careful to excel in good works. These things be good and profitable for men. But foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and controversies of the Law avoid. For they are unprofitable and vain. A man that is an heretic after the first and second admonition avoid: knowing that he that is such an one, is subverted, and sinneth, being condemned by his own judgement. When I shall send to thee Artemas or Tychicus, hasten to come unto me to Nicopolis. For there I have determined to winter. Set forward Zenas the lawyer and Apollos carefully, that nothing be wanting to them. And let our men also learn to excel in good works to necessary uses: that they be not unfruitful. All that are with me, salute thee: salute them that love us in the faith. The grace of God be with you all. Amen.</div>
