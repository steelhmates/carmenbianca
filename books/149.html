			<div class='roleText'>And the children of Ruben and Gad had much cattle, and they had in beasts an infinite substance. And when they had seen Jazer and Galaad fit countries for to feed cattle, they came to Moyses and Eleazar the Priest, and the Princes of the multitude, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why^ shall your brethren go to fight, and will you sit here? Why subvert you the minds of the children of Israel, that they may not be bold to pass into the place, which our Lord will give them? Did not your fathers so, when I sent from Cadesbarne to view the Land? And when they were come as far as the Valley of cluster, having viewed all the country, they subverted the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not enter the coasts, which our Lord gave them. Who being wrath sware, saying: If these men, that came up out of Aegypt, from twenty years and upward, shall see the land, which under oath I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and they would not follow me, except Caleb the son of Jephone the Cenezeite, and Josue the son of Nun: these have fulfilled my will. And our Lord being wrath against Israel, led him about through the desert forty years, until the whole generation was consumed, that had done evil in his sight. And behold, quoth he, you are risen up in stead of your fathers, the offspring and disciples of sinful men, to augment the fury of our Lord against Israel. But if you will not follow him, he will leave the people in the wilderness, and you shall be the cause of the death of all. </div>

We will not return into our houses, until the children of Israel possess their inheritance: neither will we seek any thing beyond Jordan, because already we have our possession on the east side thereof. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Moyses therefore gave to the children of Gad and Ruben, and to the half tribe of Manasses the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sehon king of the Amorrhite, and the Kingdom of Og king of Basan, and their land and the cities thereof round about. Therefore the sons of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, and Etroth, and Sophan, and Iazar, and Iegbaa, and Bethnemra, and Betharan, cities fenced, and sheepcotes for their sheep. But the children of Ruben builded Hesebon, and Eleale, &amp; Cariathaim, and Nabo, and Baalmeon changing their names, Sabama also: giving names to the cities, which they had built. Moreover the children of Machir, the son of Manasses, went into Galaad, and wasted it killing the Amorrhite the inhabiter thereof. Moyses therefore gave the land of Galaad to Machir the son of Manasses, who dwelt in it. And Jair the son of Manasses went, and took the villages thereof, which he called Havoth Jair, that is to say, the Villages of Jair. Nobe also went, and took Canath with the villages thereof: and he called it by his own name Nobe.</div>
