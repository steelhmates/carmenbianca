			<div class='roleText'>Let us sing to our Lord: for he is gloriously magnified, the horse and the rider he hath thrown into the sea. My strength, and my praise is our Lord, and he is made unto me a salvation: this is my God, and I will glorify him: the God of my father, and I will exalt him. Our Lord is a man of war, Omnipotent is his name. Pharao's chariots and his army he hath cast into the sea: his chosen Princes are drowned in the red sea. The depths have overwhelmed them, they are sunk into the bottom like a stone. Thy right hand, o Lord, is magnified in strength: thy right hand, o Lord, hath strucken the enemy. And in the multitude of thy glory thou hast put down thy adversaries: thou hast sent thy wrath, which hath devoured them like stubble. And in the spirit of thy fury were the waters gathered together: the flowing water stood, the depths were gathered together in the midst of the sea. The enemy said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The spirit blew and the sea overwhelmed them: they sank as lead in the vehement waters. Who is like to thee among the strong, o Lord? Who is like to thee, magnifical in sanctity, terrible and laudable, doing marvels? Thou didst stretch forth thy hand, and the earth devoured them. Thou hast in thy mercy been a guide to the people which thou hast redeemed: &amp; in thy strength thou hast carried them unto thy holy habitation. Nations rose up, and were angry: sorrows possessed the inhabiters of Philisthiim. Then were the Princes of Edom troubled, trembling ceased on the sturdy of Moab: all the inhabiters of Chanaan were stark. Let fear and dread fall upon them, in the greatness of thy arm: Let them become unmovable as a stone, until thy people, o Lord, shall pass, until thy people shall pass, this which thou hast possessed. Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in thy most firm habitation, which thou hast wrought, o Lord: thy sanctuary Lord, which thy hands have confirmed. Our Lord shall reign for ever and evermore. For Pharao on horseback entered in with his chariots &amp; horsemen into the sea: and our Lord brought back upon them the waters of the sea: but the children of Israel walked on dry ground in the midst thereof. </div>
