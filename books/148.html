			<div class='roleText'>And they gave a thousand of every tribe, that is to say, twelve thousand well appointed to fight: whom Moyses sent with Phinees the son of Eleazar the Priest, and the holy vessels, and the trumpets to sound he delivered to him. And when they had fought against the Madianites and had overcome, all the men they slew, and their kings Evi, and Recem, and Sur, and Hur, and Rebe, five Princes of the Nation: Balaam also the son of Beor they killed with the sword. And they took their wives, and little ones, and all their goods: whatsoever they had been able to make, they spoiled: as well cities as towns and castles the fire did consume. And they took the prey, and all things that they had taken as well of men as of beasts, and they brought them to Moyses, and Eleazar the Priest, and to all the multitude of the children of Israel. But the rest of the implements they carried to the camp in the champion countries of Moab, beside Jordan against Jericho. And Moyses and Eleazar the Priest went forth, &amp; all the Princes of the synagogue to meet them without the camp. And Moyses being angry with the Princes of the host, the tribunes, and the centurions that were come from the battle, said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why have you reserved the women? Are not these they, that deceived the children of Israel at the suggestion of Balaam, and made you prevaricate against our Lord upon the sin of Phogor, whereupon also the people was strucken? Therefore kill all whatsoever is of the male sex, among the little ones also: &amp; the women, that have known men in carnal copulation, slay ye: but the girls and all the women that are virgins reserve to you: and tarry without the camp seven days. He that hath killed a man, or touched him that is killed, shall be expiated the third day and the seventh. And of all the prey, whether it be garment, or vessel, and something prepared for implements, of goats' skins, and hair, and wood shall be expiated. </div>

Out of the half part also of the children of Israel thou shalt take the fiftieth head of mankind, and of oxen, and asses, and sheep, and of all beasts, and thou shalt give them to the Levites, that watch in the custodies of the tabernacle of the Lord. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>And Moyses and Eleazar did, as our Lord commanded. And the prey which the host had taken, was of sheep six hundred seventy five thousand, of oxen seventy two thousand, of asses sixty one thousand. The souls of the folks of the female sex, that had not known men, thirty two thousand. And the half part was given to them, that had been in the battle, of sheep three hundred thirty seven thousand five hundred: of the which for the portion of our Lord where reckoned sheep six hundred seventy five. And of the thirty six thousand oxen, oxen seventy and two: of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, asses sixty one: of the souls of mankind sixteen thousand, there fell to the portion of our Lord thirty two souls. And Moyses delivered the number of the first fruits of our Lord to Eleazar the Priest, as it had been commanded him, of the half part of the children of Israel, which he had separated to them, that had been in the battle. But of the half part that had chanced to the rest of the multitude, that is to say, of the three hundred thirty seven thousand five hundred sheep, and of the thirty six thousand oxen, and of the thirty thousand five hundred asses, and of the sixteen thousand of mankind, Moyses took the fiftieth head, and gave it to the Levites, that watched in the tabernacle of our Lord, as our Lord had commanded. And when the Princes of the host were come to Moyses, and the tribunes, and centurions, they said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>We thy servants have reckoned the number of the warriors, which we had under our hand: and not so much as one verily was lacking. For this cause we offer in the donaries of our Lord every one^ that which we could find in the prey of gold, garters and tablets, rings and bracelets, and chains, that thou mayest pray to our Lord for us. </div>
