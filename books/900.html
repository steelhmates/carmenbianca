			<div class='roleText'>To the children of Ammon. Thus saith our Lord: Why, hath Israel no children? Or hath he not an heir? Why then hath Melchom by inheritance possessed Gad: and his people dwelt in his cities? Therefore behold the days come saith our Lord: and I will make the noise of battle to be heard upon Rabbath the children of Ammon, and it shall be destroyed into an heap, and her daughters shall be burnt with fire, &amp; Israel shall possess his possessors, saith our Lord. Howl Hesebon, because Hai is wasted. Cry ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with cloths of hair: mourn and go about by the hedges: because Melchom shall be led into transmigration, his Priests, and his Princes together. What gloriest thou in the valleys? Thy valley hath flowed away o delicate daughter, which didst trust in thy treasures, &amp; saidst: Who shall come to me? Behold I will bring terror upon thee, saith our Lord the God of hosts, from all that are round about thee: &amp; you shall be dispersed every one from another's sight, neither shall there be any to gather together them that fly. And after these things I will make the captives of the children of Ammon to return, saith our Lord. To Idumea. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Why is wisdom no more in Theman? Counsel is perished from the children: their wisdom is become unprofitable. Fly and turn your backs, go down into the gulf ye inhabitants of Dedan: because I have brought the perdition of Esau upon him, the time of his visitation. If the grape gatherers had come upon thee, they had not left a cluster: if thieves in the night, they had taken that should suffice them. But I have discovered Esau, I have revealed his secrets, and he cannot be concealed: his seed is wasted, and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he shall not be. Leave thy pupils: I will make them live: and thy widows shall hope in me. For thus saith our Lord: Behold they whose judgement was not to drink the cup, drinking shall drink: and shalt thou be left as innocent? Thou shalt not be innocent, but drinking thou shalt drink. Because I have sworn by myself, saith our Lord, that Bosra shall be into desolation, &amp; into reproach, and into a desert, and into malediction: and all her cities shall be into everlasting desolations. I have heard a bruit from our Lord, &amp; a legate is sent to the Nations: Gather yourselves together, and come against her, and let us rise up into battle. For behold I have made thee a little one in the Gentiles, contemptible among men. Thine arrogancy hath deceived thee, and the pride of thy heart: which dwellest in the caves of the rock, and endeavourest to apprehend the height of the hill. When thou shalt exalt thy nest as an eagle, thence will I bring thee down, saith our Lord. And Idumea shall be desolate: every one that shall pass by it, shall be astonished, &amp; shall hiss upon all the plagues thereof. As Sodom is overthrown and Gomorrha, and her neighbours saith our Lord: there shall not a man dwell there, and there shall no son of man inhabit it. Behold as a lion he shall come up from the pride of Jordan, to the strong beautifulness: because I will make him run suddenly to her: &amp; who shall be a chosen one whom I may appoint over her? For who is like to me? And who shall abide me? And who is this Pastor that can resist my countenance? Therefore hear ye the counsel of our Lord, which he hath taken concerning Edom: and his cogitations, which he hath thought concerning the inhabitants of Theman: If the little ones of the flock shall not cast them down, if they shall not destroy their habitation with them. At the voice of their ruin the earth is moved: the cry of their voice is heard in the Red sea. Behold he shall come up as an eagle, &amp; fly out: and he shall spread his wings over Bosra: and the heart of the strong of Idumea shall be in that day, as the heart of a woman in travail. To Damascus. Emath is confounded and Arphad: because they have heard a very ill bruit, they are troubled in the sea: for carefulness it could not be quiet. Damascus is undone, she is turned into flight, trembling hath apprehended her: anguish and sorrows have held her as a woman in travail. How have they forsaken the laudable city, the city of joy! Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and all the men of war shall be silent in that day, saith the Lord of hosts. And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall devour the walls of Benadad. To Cedar, and to the kingdoms of Asor, which Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon hath strucken. Thus saith our Lord: Arise, &amp; go ye up to Cedar, and waste the children of the East. They shall take their tabernacles, and their flocks: their curtains, and all their vessels, &amp; their camels they shall take to them: and they shall call upon them fear round about. Fly ye, get away speedily, sit in deep pits you that inhabit Asor, saith our Lord: for Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon hath taken counsel against you, &amp; hath devised devices against you. Arise, and go up to the nation that is quiet, and that dwellest confidently, saith our Lord, they have neither doors, nor bars: they dwell alone. And their camels shall be into spoil, &amp; the multitude of beasts for a prey: and I will disperse them into every wind, which have their hair polled: and from every confine of theirs, I will bring destruction upon them, saith our Lord. And Asor shall be for an habitation of dragons, desolate for ever: there shall no man tarry there, nor son of man inhabit it. The word of our Lord that was made to Jeremy the Prophet against Aelam, in the beginning of the kingdom of Sedecias king of Juda, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Behold I will break the bow of Aelam, and their chief strength. And I will bring upon Aelam the four winds from the four coasts of heaven: and I will scatter them into all these winds: and there shall not be a nation, to which the fugitives of Aelam shall not come. And I will make Aelam to fear before his enemies, and in the sight of them that seek their life: and I will bring evil upon them, the wrath of my fury, saith our Lord: and I will send the sword after them, till I consume them. And I will set my throne in Aelam, and destroy kings and Princes from thence, saith our Lord. But in the last days I will cause the captives of Aelam to return, saith our Lord.</div>
