			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. I have loved, because our Lord will hear the voice of my prayer. Because he hath inclined his ear to me: and in my days I will invocate. The sorrows of death have compassed me: and the perils of hell have found me. I have found tribulation and sorrow: and I invocated the name of our Lord. O Lord deliver my soul: our Lord is merciful, and just, and our God doth mercy. Our Lord keepeth little ones: I was humbled, and he hath delivered me. Turn o my soul into thy rest: because our Lord hath done good to thee. Because he hath delivered my soul from death: mine eyes from tears, my feet from sliding. I will please our Lord in the country of the living.</div>
