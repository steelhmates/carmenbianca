			<div class='roleText'>Strike the hinges, &amp; let the lintels be moved: for there is avarice in the head of all, &amp; the last of them will I kill by the sword: there shall be no flight for them: they shall fly, &amp; he shall not be saved that shall fly of them. If they shall descend even to hell, thence shall my hand bring them out: and if they shall ascend even to heaven, thence will I pluck them down. And if they shall be hid in the top of Carmel, thence searching will I take them away: and if they shall hide themselves from mine eyes in the depth of the sea, there will I command the serpent, and he shall bite them. And if they shall go into captivity before their enemies, there will I command the sword, &amp; it shall kill them. And I will set mine eyes upon them to evil, and not to good. And our Lord the God of hosts, which toucheth the earth, &amp; it shall melt away: and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it shall all rise as a river, and shall run down as the flood of Aegypt. He that buildeth in heaven his ascension, &amp; hath founded his bundle upon the earth: who calleth the waters of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth, the Lord is his name. Why, are not you as the children of the Aethiopians unto me, o children of Israel, saith our Lord? Did not I make Israel to ascend out of the Land of Aegypt: and the Palesthins out of Cappadocia, and the Syrians out of Cyrenee? Behold the eyes of our Lord God upon the sinning kingdom, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth: but yet destroying I will not destroy the house of Jacob, saith our Lord. For behold I will command, &amp; will shake the house of Israel in all nations, as wheat is shaken in a sieve: and there shall not a little stone fall upon the earth. All the sinners of my people shall fall by the sword: which say: The evil shall not approach, &amp; shall not come upon us. In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David, that was fallen: &amp; I will re-edify the breaches of the walls thereof, and those things, that were fallen I will repair: &amp; I will re-edify him as in the days of old. That they may possess the remnant of Idumea, and all nations, because that my name is invocated upon them: saith our Lord that doth these things. Behold the days come, saith our Lord: and the plougher shall overtake the reaper, and the treader of the grape him that soweth seed: and the mountains shall drop sweetness, and all hills shall be tilled. And I will convert the captivity of my people Israel: and they shall build the desert cities, and inhabit: and shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine of them: and shall make gardens, and eat the fruits of them. And I will plant them upon their own ground: &amp; I will no more pluck them out of their land, which I have given them, saith our Lord thy God.</div>
