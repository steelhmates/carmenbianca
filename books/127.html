			<div class='roleText'>Make thee two trumpets of beaten silver, wherewith thou mayest call together the multitude when the camp is to be removed. And when thou shalt sound with the trumpets, all the multitude shall gather unto thee to the door of the tabernacle of covenant. If thou sound but once, the Princes shall come to thee, and the heads of the multitude of Israel. But if the trumpeting sound in length and with a broken tune, they shall move their camp first that are on the east side. And at the second sound and the like noise of the trumpet, they shall take up their tents that dwell toward the south, and after this manner shall the rest do, when the trumpets shall sound to the marching. But when the people is to be gathered together, the sound of the trumpet shall be plain, and they shall not make a broken sound. And the sons of Aaron the Priests shall sound with the trumpets: and this shall be an ordinance for ever in your generations. If you go forth to war out of your land against the enemies that fight against you, you shall sound with trumpets in length, and there shall be remembrance of you before the Lord your God, that you may be delivered out of the hands of your enemies. If at any time you shall have a banquet, &amp; festival days, and Calends, you shall sound with trumpets over the holocausts, &amp; pacific victims, that they may be unto you for a remembrance of your God. I^ the Lord your God. </div>

And in the tribe of Simeon, the Prince was Salamiel the son of Surisaddai. Moreover in the tribe of Gad, the Prince was Eliasaph the son of Duel.
