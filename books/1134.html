			<div class='roleText'>AND he said also to his Disciples: There was a certain rich man that had a bailiff: &amp; he was ill reported of unto him, as he that had wasted his goods. And he called him, and said to him: What hear I this of thee? Render account of thy bailiffship: for now thou canst no more be bailiff. And the bailiff said within himself: What shall I do, because my lord taketh away from me the bailiffship? Dig I am not able, to beg I am ashamed. I know what I will do, that when I shall be removed from the bailiffship, they may receive me into their houses. Therefore calling together every one of his lord's debters, he said to the first: How much doest thou owe my lord? But he saith: An hundred pipes of oil. And he said to him: Take thy bill and sit down, quickly write fifty. After that he said to another: But thou, how much doest thou owe? Who said: </div>

And the lord praised the bailiff of iniquity, because he had done wisely: for the children of this world, are wiser than the children of light in their generation. And I say to you: Make unto you friends of the mammon of iniquity that when you fail, they may receive you into the eternal tabernacles. He that is faithful in the least, is faithful in the greater also: and he that is unjust in little, is unjust in the greater also. If then you have not been faithful in the unjust mammon, with that which is the true who may credit you? And if you have not been faithful in other men's, that which is yours, who will give you? No servant can serve two masters; for either he shall hate the one, and love the other; or cleave to one, and contemn the other. You cannot serve God and mammon. And the Pharisees which were covetous, heard all these things: and they derided him. And he said to them: You are they that justify yourselves before men, but God knoweth your hearts, because that which is high to men, is abomination before God. The Law and the Prophets, unto John. From that time the Kingdom of God is evangelized, and every one doth force toward it. And it is easier for Heaven and earth to pass, than one tittle of the law to fall. Every one that dismisseth his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and he that marrieth her that is dismissed from her husband, committeth adultery. There was a certain rich man, &amp; he was clothed with purple and silk: and he fared every day magnifically. And there was a certain beggar called Lazarus, that lay at his gate, full of sores: desiring to be filled of the crumbs, that fell from the rich man's table, but the dogs also came, and licked his sores. And it came to pass that the beggar died, and was carried of the Angels into Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died: and he was buried in hell. And lifting up his eyes, when he was in torments, he saw Abraham a far off, and Lazarus in his bosom: and he crying said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger into water for to cool my tongue, because I am tormented in this flame. And Abraham said to him: Son, remember that thou didst receive good things in thy life time, and Lazarus likewise evil: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. And beside all these things, between us and you there is fixed a great chaos: that they which will pass from hence to you, may not, neither go from thence hither. And he said: </div>
