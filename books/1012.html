			<div class='roleText'>Now shalt thou be spoiled daughter of the spoiler: they have laid siege upon us, with a rod shall they strike the cheek of the judge of Israel. AND THOU BETHLEHEM, Ephrata, art a little one in the thousands of Juda: out of thee shall come forth unto me he that shall be the dominatour in Israel: &amp; his coming forth from the beginning, from the days of eternity. Therefore shall he give them even till the time, wherein she that travaileth shall bring forth: &amp; the remnant of his brethren shall be converted to the children of Israel. And he shall stand, &amp; feed in the strength of our Lord, in the height of the name of our Lord his God: &amp; they shall be converted, because now shall he be magnified even to the ends of the earth. And this man shall be peace: when the Assyrian shall come into our land, and when he shall tread in our houses: &amp; we will raise upon him seven Pastors, &amp; eight principal men. And they shall feed the land of Assur in the sword, and the land of Nemrod in the spears thereof: &amp; he shall deliver from Assur, when he shall come into our Land, &amp; when he shall tread in our coasts. And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many peoples as dew from our Lord, &amp; as drops upon the grass, which expecteth not man, &amp; tarrieth not for the children of men. And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the Gentiles in the midst of many peoples, as a lion among the beasts of the forests, and as a lion's whelp among the flocks of cattle: who when he hath passed, &amp; trodden down, &amp; taken, there is none to deliver. Thy hand shall be exalted over thine enemies, &amp; all thine enemies shall perish. And it shall be in that day, saith our Lord: I will take away thy horses out of the midst of thee, &amp; will destroy thy chariots. And I will destroy the cities of thy land, &amp; will destroy all thy munitions, &amp; I will take away sorceries out of thy hand, &amp; there shall be no divinations in thee. And I will make thy sculptiles to perish, and thy statues out of the midst of thee: and thou shalt no more adore the works of thy hands. And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: &amp; will destroy thy cities. And I will do vengeance in fury and in indignation among all the nations, that have not heard.</div>
