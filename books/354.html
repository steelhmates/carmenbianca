			<div class='roleText'>They therefore brought the Ark of God, and set it in the midst of the tabernacle, which David had pitched for it: and they offered holocausts, and pacifics before God. And when David had finished offering holocausts, and pacifics, he blessed the people in the name of our Lord. And he divided to all throughout every one, from man unto woman, a loaf of bread, and a piece of roasted beef, and flour fried with oil. And he appointed before the Ark of our Lord of the Levites, that should minister, and should remember his works, and glorify, and praise our Lord the God of Israel: Asaph the Prince, and the second after him Zacharias: moreover Jahiel, and Semiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mathathias, and Eliab, and Banaias, and Obededom: and Jehiel over the instruments of psaltery, and the harps: and Asaph to sound upon the cymbals: but Banaias, and Jaziel Priests, to sound the trumpet continually before the Ark of the covenant of our Lord. In that day David made Asaph, prince to confess to our Lord and his brethren. Confess ye to our Lord, and invocate his name: make his inventions known among the peoples. Chant to him, and sing to him: &amp; tell ye all his marvelous things. Praise ye his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice, that seek our Lord. Seek ye our Lord, and his power: seek ye his face always. Remember his marvelous things which he hath done: his signs, and the judgements of his mouth. The seed of Israel his servant: the children of Jacob his elect. He is the Lord our God: in all the earth are his judgements. Remember for ever his covenant: the word, which he commanded unto a thousand generations. Which he covenanted with Abraham: and his oath with Isaac. And he appointed it to Jacob for a precept: and to Israel for an everlasting covenant: Saying: To thee will I give the Land of Chanaan: the cord of your inheritance. When they were few in number: small and sojourners thereof. And they passed from nation into nation: and from Kingdom to another people. He suffered not any man to calumniate them: but rebuked kings for their sake. Touch not my anointed: and unto my Prophets be not malicious. Sing ye to our Lord all the earth: shew forth from day to day his salvation. Tell his glory among the gentiles: among all peoples his marvelous works. Because our Lord is great, and laudable exceedingly: and terrible over all gods. For all the gods of the peoples, be idols: but our Lord made the heavens. Confession and magnificence before him: strength and joy in his place. Bring to our Lord ye families of peoples: bring to our Lord glory and empire. Give our Lord glory, to his name, elevate sacrifice, and come ye in his sight: and adore our Lord in holy honour. Let all the earth be moved before his face: for he founded the world unmovable. Let the heavens be glad, and the earth rejoice: and let them say among nations, Our Lord hath reigned. Let the sea thunder, and the fullness thereof: let the fields rejoice, and all things that are in them. Then shall the trees of the forest praise before our Lord: because he is come to judge the earth. Confess ye to our Lord, because he is good: because his mercy is for ever. And say ye: Save us o God our Saviour: and gather us together, and deliver us out of the nations, that we may confess to thy holy name, and may rejoice in thy songs. Blessed be our Lord the God of Israel from eternity unto eternity: and let all the people say: Amen, and hymn to God. He therefore left Asaph there before the Ark of the covenant of our Lord, and his brethren to minister in the presence of the Ark continually day by day, &amp; in their courses. Moreover Obededom, and his brethren sixty eight: and Obededom the son of Idithun, and Hosa he appointed for porters. And Sadoc the Priest, and his brethren Priests, before the tabernacle of our Lord in the excelse, which was in Gabaon, that they should offer holocausts to our Lord upon the altar of holocaust continually, morning and evening, according to all things that are written in the law of our Lord, which he commanded Israel. And after him Heman, and Idithun, and the rest of the chosen men, every one by his name to confess unto our Lord: because his mercy is for ever. Heman also and Idithun sounding the trumpet, and quavering on the cymbals, and all musical instruments to sing unto God: and the sons of Idithun he made porters. And all the people returned into their house: and David, to bless also his house.</div>
