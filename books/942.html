			<div class='roleText'>I am God, and I have sitten in the chair of God in the heart of the sea: whereas thou art a man, and not God: and hast given thy heart as the heart of God. Lo thou art wiser than Daniel: every secret is not hid from thee. In thy wisdom and thy prudence thou hast made thee strength: and hast gotten gold, and silver in thy treasures. In the multitude of thy wisdom, &amp; in thy merchandise thou hast multiplied strength to thee: and thy heart is elevated in thy strength. Therefore thus saith our Lord God: For that thy heart is elevated as the heart of God: therefore behold I will bring upon thee strangers, the strongest of the Gentiles: and they shall draw their swords upon the beauty of thy wisdom, and shall pollute thy comeliness. They shall kill, and pluck thee down: and thou shalt die in the death of the slain in the heart of the sea. Why, shalt thou speak saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Son of man lift up a lamentation upon the king of Tyre: and thou shalt say to him: Thus saith our Lord God: Thou the signet of similitude, full of wisdom, and perfect of beauty, thou wast in the delicacies of the paradise of God: every precious stone thy covering: sardius, topatius, and the jasper, chrysolithus, and onyx, and berillus, the sapphire, and the carbuncle, and the emerald: gold the work of thy beauty: &amp; thy pipes were prepared in the day, that thou wast created. Thou Cherub stretched out, and protecting, and I set thee in the holy mount of God, in the midst of fiery stones thou hast walked. Perfect in thy ways from the day of thy creation, until iniquity was found in thee. In the multitude of thy merchandise, thine inner parts were filled with iniquity, and thou didst sin: and I cast thee out from the mount of God, and destroyed thee o Cherub protecting, out of the midst of the fiery stones. And thy heart was elevated in thy beauty: thou hast lost thy wisdom in thy beauty, I have cast thee to the earth: before the face of kings I have given thee, that they might behold thee. In the multitude of thine iniquities, and in the iniquity of thy merchandise, thou hast polluted thy sanctification: I will therefore bring forth a fire out of the midst of thee, to eat thee, and I will make thee as ashes upon the earth in the sight of all that see thee. All that shall see thee in the Gentiles, shall be astonished upon thee: thou art become a thing of naught, and thou shalt not be for ever. And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, set thy face against Sidon: and thou shalt prophesy of it, and shalt say: Thus saith our Lord God: Behold I to thee Sidon, and I will be glorified in the midst of thee: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall do judgements in it, and shall be sanctified in it. And I will send into it pestilence, and blood in the streets thereof: and the slain shall fall in the midst thereof by the sword round about: and they shall know that I am the Lord. And there shall be no more scandal of bitterness to the house of Israel, &amp; thorn causing pain on every side round about them that are against them: and they shall know that I am the Lord God. Thus saith our Lord God: When I shall have gathered together the house of Israel out of the peoples, in which they are dispersed: I will be sanctified in them before the Gentiles: and they shall dwell in their land, which I gave to my servant Jacob. And they shall dwell therein secure, and they shall build houses, and shall plant vineyards, &amp; shall dwell confidently, when I shall have done judgements in all, that are their enemies round about: and they shall know that I am the Lord their God.</div>
