			<div class='roleText'>AFTER^ JESUS manifested himself again to the Disciples at the sea of Tiberias. And he manifested thus. There were together Simon Peter, and Thomas who is called Didymus, and Nathanael which was of Cana in Galilee, &amp; the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his Disciples. Simon Peter saith to them: I go to fish. They say to him: We also come with thee. And they went forth and got up into the boat: and that night they took nothing. But when morning was now come, JESUS stood on the shore: yet the Disciples knew not that it was JESUS. JESUS therefore saith to them: Children, have you any meat? They answered him, No. He saith to them: Cast the net on the right side of the boat; and you shall find. They therefore did cast it: and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. That Disciples therefore whom JESUS loved, saith to Peter: It is our Lord. Simon Peter when he had heard that it is our Lord, girded his coat unto him (for he was naked) &amp; cast himself into the sea. But the other Disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, but as it were two hundred cubits) drawing the net of fishes. Therefore after they came down to land, they saw hot coals lying, and fish laid thereon, and bread. JESUS saith to them: Bring hither of the fishes that you took now. Simon Peter went up, and drew the net to the land, full of great fishes, an hundred fifty three. And although they were so many the net was not broken. JESUS saith to them: Come, dine. And none of them that sat at meat, durst ask him: Who art thou? knowing that it is our Lord. And JESUS cometh &amp; taketh the bread and giveth them, &amp; the fish in like manner. This now the third time JESUS was manifested to his Disciples, after he was risen from the dead. Therefore when they had dined, JESUS saith to Simon Peter: Simon of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: FEED MY LAMBS. He saith to him again: Simon of John, lovest thou me? He saith to him: Yea Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. He saith to him: FEED MY LAMBS. He saith to him the third time: Simon of John, lovest thou me? Peter was stroken sad because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him: Lord, thou knowest all things: thou knowest that I love thee. He said to him: FEED MY SHEEP. Amen, amen I say to thee, when thou wast younger, thou didst gird thyself, and didst walk where thou wouldest. But when thou shalt be old thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and lead thee whither thou wilt not. And this he said, signifying by what death he should glorify God. And when he had said this, he saith to him: Follow me. Peter turning, saw that Disciple whom JESUS loved, following, who also leaned at the supper upon his breast, and said, Lord who is he that shall betray thee? Him therefore when Peter had seen, he saith to JESUS: Lord, and this man what? JESUS saith to him: So I will have him to remain till I come, what to thee? follow thou me. This saying therefore went abroad among the brethren, that that Disciple dieth not. And JESUS did not say to him, he dieth not; but, So I will have him to remain till I come, what to thee? This is that Disciple which giveth testimony of these things, and hath written these things: and we know that his testimony is true. But there are many other things also which JESUS did: which if they were written in particular, neither the world it-self I think were able to contain those books that should be written.</div>
