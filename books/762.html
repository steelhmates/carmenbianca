			<div class='roleText'>He that will be revenged, shall find revenge of our Lord, and keeping he will keep his sin. Forgive thy neighbour hurting thee: &amp; then shall thy sins be loosed to thee when thou prayest. Man to man reserveth anger, and doth he seek remedy of God? He hath not mercy on a man like unto himself, and doth he entreat for his own sins? Himself whereas he is flesh, reserveth anger, and doth he ask propitiation of God? Who by prayer shall obtain for his sin? Remember the last things, &amp; cease to be at enmity: for consumption and death are imminent in his commandments. Remember the fear of God, and be not angry with thy neighbour. Remember the testament of the High, &amp; contemn the ignorance of thy neighbour. Refrain thyself from strife, and thou shalt diminish thy sins: for an angry man kindleth strife, and a sinful man will trouble his friends, and in the midst of them that are at peace he will cast in enmity. For according to the wood of the forest, so the fire burneth: and according to the power of a man, so shall his anger be, and according to his substance he will increase his anger. Hasty contention kindleth a fire: &amp; hasty strife sheddeth blood: and an ill testifying tongue bringeth death. If thou blow upon a spark, it will burn as a fire: and if thou spit thereon, it shall be quenched: both proceed out of the mouth. The whisperer &amp; double tongued is accurst: for he hath troubled many that were at peace. A third tongue hath moved many, and dispersed them from nation into nation. It hath destroyed the walled cities of the rich, and hath digged down the houses of great men. It hath cut the forces of peoples, and undone strong nations. A third tongue hath cast out many women, and deprived them of their labours. He that regardeth it, shall not have rest, neither shall he have a friend in whom he may repose. The stroke of a whip maketh a blue mark: but the stroke of the tongue will break the bones. Many have fallen by the edge of the sword, but not so as they that have perished by their tongue. Blessed is he that is covered from a wicked tongue, that hath not passed into the anger thereof, and that hath not drawn the yoke thereof, and hath not been tied in the bands thereof: for the yoke of it is a yoke of iron: and the band of it is a band of brass. The death of it, is a most wicked death: and hell is more profitable than it. The continuance of it shall not be permanent, but it shall obtain the ways of the unjust: and it shall not burn the just in the flame thereof. They that forsake God, shall fall into it, and it shall burn in them, and shall not be quenched, and it shall be sent in upon them as a lion, and as a leopard it shall hurt them. Hedge thine ears with thorns, and hear not a wicked tongue, and make doors to thy mouth, and locks. Lay together thy silver, and make balance to thy words, and right bridles to thy mouth: and take heed lest perhaps thou slip in thy tongue, &amp; fall in the sight of the enemies, that lie in wait for thee, and thy fall be uncurable unto death.</div>
