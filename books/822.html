			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass, when king Ezechias had heard it, he rent his garments, and was wrapped in sack cloth, and entered into the house of our Lord. And he sent Eliacim which was over the house, and Sobna the scribe and the ancients of the priests covered with sackcloths to Isaie, the son of Amos the Prophet. and they said to him: Thus saith Ezechias: This day is a day of tribulation and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: because the children are come even to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. If by any means our Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of Assyrians his lord hath sent to blaspheme the living God, and to upbraid with words which our Lord thy God hath heard: lift up prayer therefore for the remnant that are left. And the servants of Ezechias came to Isaie. And Isaie said to them: Thus shall you say to your master: Thus saith our Lord: Fear not at the face of the words, which thou hast heard, wherewith the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me. Behold, I will give him a spirit, and he shall hear a message, and shall return to his country, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own country. And Rabsaces returned, and found the king of Assyrians fighting against Lobna. For he heard that he was departed from Lachis, and he heard of Tharaca the king of Aethiopia, them that said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. Lo thou hast heard all things the kings of the Assyrians have done to all countries, which they have subverted, &amp; canst thou be delivered? Why, have the gods of the nations delivered them, whom my fathers have subverted, Gozam, and Haram, and Reseph, and the children of Eden, that were in Thalassar? Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana, &amp; Ava? And Ezechias took the letters of the hand of the messengers, &amp; read them, and went up into the house of our Lord, and Ezechias laid them open before our Lord. And Ezechias prayed to our Lord, saying: O Lord of hosts God of Israel, which sittest upon the Cherubs, thou art the only God of all the kingdoms of the earth, thou hast made heaven and earth. Incline o Lord thine ear, &amp; hear: open o Lord thine eyes, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God. For in very deed, o Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have made lands desolate, and the countries of the same. And they have given their gods to fire: for they were not gods, but the works of men's hands, wood and stone: &amp; they brake them in pieces. And now, o Lord our God, save us out of his hand: and let all the kingdoms of the earth know, that thou only art the Lord. And Isaie the son of Amos sent to Ezechias, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Thus saith our Lord the God of Israel: For the things that thou prayed me concerning Sennacherib the king of Assyrians: this is the word which our Lord hath spoken upon him: The virgin daughter of Sion hath despised thee, and scorned thee: the daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged the head after thee. Whom hast thou upbraided, and whom hast thou blasphemed, and upon whom hast thou exalted voice, and lifted up the height of thine eyes? To the holy one of Israel. By the hand of thy servants thou hast upbraided our Lord, &amp; hast said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>In the multitude of my chariots have I climbed the height of mountains, the tops of Libanus: &amp; I will cut down the high cedars thereof, &amp; the chosen fir trees thereof, and will enter to the top of the height thereof, to the forest of his Carmel. I have digged, and drunken the water, and have dried up with the step of my foot all the rivers of the rampiers. Why, hast thou not heard, what I have done to him of old? From ancient days have I formed it: and now I have brought it to effect: and it is made to the rooting out of little hills bickering together, and of fenced cities. The inhabitants of them with shortened hand have trembled, and are confounded: they are become as hay of the field, and grass of the pasture ground, and herb of the housetops which hath withered before it was ripe. I have known thy habitation, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy madness against me. When thou didst rage against me, thy pride ascended into mine ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nostrils, and a bit in thy lips, and will bring thee back into the way, by which thou camest. But to thee this shall be a sign: eat this year the things that grow to themselves, and in the second year eat fruits: but in the third year sow &amp; reap, &amp; plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. And that which shall be saved of the house of Juda, and which is left, shall take root downward, and shall bear fruit upward: because out of Jerusalem there shall a remnant go forth, and salvation from mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this. Therefore thus saith our Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not enter this city, and he shall not shoot arrow there, and shield shall not occupy it, and he shall not cast rampier about it: In the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and into this city he shall not enter, saith our Lord. And I will protect this city, that I may save it for mine own sake, and for David's sake my servant. And the Angel of our Lord came forth, and struck in the camp of the Assyrians an hundred eighty five thousand. And they arose in the morning, and behold, all were carcasses of dead men. And he went out, and departed, and Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians returned, and dwelt in Ninive. And it came to pass, when he adored in the temple of Nesroch his god, Adramelech &amp; Sarasar his sons struck him with the sword: and they fled into the land of Ararat, &amp; Asarhaddon his son reigned for him.</div>
