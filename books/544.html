			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, the Psalm of David, for excess of mind. In thee o Lord have I hoped, let me not be confounded for ever: in thy justice deliver me. Incline thine ear to me, make haste to deliver me. Be unto me for a God protector: and for a house of refuge, that thou mayst save me. Because thou art my strength, and my refuge: and for thy name thou wilt conduct me, and wilt nourish me. Thou wilt bring me out of this snare, which they have hid for me: because thou art my protector. Into thy hands I commend my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, o Lord God of truth. Thou hast hated them that observe vanities, unprofitably. But I have hoped in our Lord: I shall rejoice and be joyful in thy mercy. Because thou hast respected my humility, thou hast saved my soul out of necessities. Neither hast thou shut me up in the hands of the enemy: thou hast set my feet in a large place. Have mercy upon me, o Lord, because I am in tribulation: mine eye is troubled for wrath, my soul, and my belly: Because my life is decayed for sorrow: and my years for groanings. My strength is weakened for poverty; and my bones are troubled. Above all mine enemies I am made a reproach, both to my neighbours exceedingly: and a fear to my acquaintance. They that saw me, fled forth from me: I am forgotten, from the heart as one dead. I am made as a vessel destroyed: because I have heard the reprehension of many that abide round about: In that whilst, they assembled together against me, they consulted to take my soul. But I have hoped in thee. O Lord: I said, Thou art my God: my lots are in thy hands. Deliver me out of the hands of my enemies, and from them that persecute me. Illustrate thy face upon thy servant, save me in thy mercy: Lord let me not be confounded, because I have invocated thee. Let the impious be ashamed, and brought down into hell: let the deceitful lips be made mute. Which speak iniquity against the just, in pride and abuse. How great is the multitude of thy sweetness, o Lord which thou hast hid for them that fear thee. Thou hast perfited it for them that hope in thee, in the sight of the children of men. Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy face from the disturbance of men. Thou shall protect them in thy tabernacle from the contradiction of tongues. Blessed be our Lord: because he hath made his mercy marvelous to me in the fenced city. But I have said in the excess of my mind: I am cast away from the sight of thine eyes. Therefore thou hast heard the voice of my prayer, whilst I cried to thee. Love our Lord all ye his Saints: because our Lord will require truth, &amp; will repay them aboundantly that do proudly. Do ye manfully, and let your heart take courage, all ye that hope in our Lord.</div>
