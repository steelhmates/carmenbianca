			<div class='roleText'>I AM the true vine; and my Father is the husband-man. Every branch in me, not bearing fruit, he will take it away: &amp; every one that beareth fruit, he will purge it, that it may bring more fruit. Now you are clean for the word which I have spoken to you. Abide in me: and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so you neither unless you abide in me. I am the vine: you the branches. He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same beareth much fruit: for without me you can do nothing. If any abide not in me: he shall be cast forth as the branch, and shall wither, and they shall gather him up, and cast him into the fire, and he burneth. If you abide in me, &amp; my words abide in you: you shall ask what thing soever you will, and it shall be done to you. In this my Father is glorified; that you bring very much fruit, and become my Disciples. As my Father hath loved me, I also have loved you. Abide in my love. If you keep my precepts, you shall abide in my love: as I also have kept my Father's precepts, and do abide in his love. These things I have spoken to you, that my joy may be in you, and your joy may be filled. This is my precept, that you love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love than this no man hath, that a man yield his life for his friends. You are my friends, if you do the things that I command you. Now I call you not servants: for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth. But you I have called friends; because all things whatsoever I heard of my Father, I have notified unto you. You chose not me, but I chose you; and have appointed you: that you go, &amp; bring fruit; and your fruit abide: that whatsoever you ask the Father in my name, he may give it you. These things I command you, that you love one another. If the world hate you, know ye that it hath hated me before you. If you had been of the world, the world would love his own. But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you. Remember my word that I said to you: The servant is not greater than his Master. If they have persecuted me, you also will they persecute. If they have kept my word, yours also will they keep. But all these things they will do to you for my name sake; because they know not him that sent me. If I had not come, and spoken to them, they should not have sin: but now they have no excuse of their sin. He that hateth me, hateth my Father also. If I had not done among them works that no other man hath done, they should not have sin: but now both they have seen, and they do hate both me and my Father. But that the word may be fulfilled, which is written in their law: That they hated me gratis. But when the Paraclete cometh whom I will send you from the Father, the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he shall give testimony of me: and you shall give testimony, because you are with me from the beginning.</div>
