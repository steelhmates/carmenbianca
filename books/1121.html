			<div class='roleText'>AND in the fifteenth year of the empire of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being Governor of Jewry, and Herod being Tetrarch of Galilee, and Philip his brother Tetrarch of Iturea and the country Trachonitis, and Lysanias Tetrarch of Abilina, under the high Priests Annas and Caiphas: the word of our Lord was made upon John the son of Zacharie, in the desert. And he came into all the country of Jordan, preaching the baptism of penance unto remission of sins; as it is written in the book of the sayings of Esay the Prophet: A voice of one crying in the desert; prepare the way of our Lord, make straight his paths. Every valley shall be filled; and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and crooked things shall become straight; and rough ways, plain: And all flesh shall see the SALVATION of God. He said therefore to the multitudes that went forth to be baptized of him: Ye vipers' broods, who hath shewed you to flee from the wrath to come? Yield therefore fruits worthy of penance; and do ye not begin to say, we have Abraham, to our father. For I tell you, that God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. And now the axe is put to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that yieldeth not good fruit, shall be cut down, and cast into fire. And the multitudes asked him, saying: </div>

And the Publicans also came to be baptized, and said to him: Master, what shall we do? But he said to them: Do nothing more than that which is appointed you.

			<div class='roleText'>What shall we also do? And he said to them: Vex not, neither calumniate any man; and be content with your stipends. And the people imagining, and all men thinking in their hearts of John, lest perhaps he were Christ: John answered, saying unto all: I indeed baptize you with water, but there shall come a mightier than I, whose latchet of his shoes I am not worthy to loose; he shall baptize you in the Holy Ghost and fire: whose fan is in his hand, and he will purge his floor; and will gather the wheat into his barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. Many other things also exhorting did he evangelize to the people. And Herod the Tetrarch, when he was rebuked of him for Herodias his brother's wife, and for all the evils which Herod did: He added this also above all, and shut up John into prison. And it came to pass when all the people was baptized, JESUS also being baptized and praying, Heaven was opened: And the Holy Ghost descended in corporal shape as a dove upon him: and a voice from Heaven was made: Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased. And JESUS himself was beginning to be about thirty years old: as it was thought, the son of Joseph, who was of Heli, who was of Matthat, who was of Levi, who was of Melchi, who was of Ianne, who was of Joseph, who was of Matthathias, who was of Amos, who was of Naum, who was of Hesli, who was of Nagge, who was of Mahath, who was of Matthathias, who was of Semei, who was of Joseph, who was of Juda, who was of Johanna, who was of Resa, who was of Zorobabel, who was of Salathiel, who was of Neri, who was of Melchi, who was of Addi, who was of Cosam, who was of Elmadan, who was of Her, who was of Jesus, who was of Eliezer, who was of Iorim, who was of Matthat, who was of Levi, who was of Simeon, who was of Judas, who was of Joseph, who was of Jona, who was of Eliacim. who was of Melcha, who was of Menna, who was of Matthatha, who was of Nathan, who was of David, who was of Jesse, who was of Obed, who was of Booz, who was of Salmon, who was of Naasson, who was of Aminadab, who was of Aram, who was of Esron, who was of Phares, who was of Judas, who was of Jacob, who was of Isaac, who was of Abraham, who was of Thare, who was of Nachor, who was of Sarug, who was of Ragau, who was of Phaleg, who was of Heber, who was of Sale, who was of Cainan, who was of Arphaxad, who was of Sem, who was of Noe, who was of Lamech, who was of Mathusale, who was of Henoch, who was of Jared, who was of Malaleel, who was of Cainan, who was of Henos, who was of Seth, who was of Adam, who was of God.</div>
