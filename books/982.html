			<div class='roleText'>In their tribulation early they will rise up to me: Come, &amp; let us return to our Lord. Because he hath wounded, &amp; will heal us: he will strike, &amp; will cure us. He will revive us after two days: in the third day he will raise us up, &amp; we shall live in his sight. We shall know, &amp; we shall follow, that we may know our Lord. As the morning light, is his coming forth prepared, and he will come to us as a shower timely, and late to the earth. What shall I do to thee Ephraim? What shall I do to thee Juda? Your mercy as a morning cloud, &amp; as the dew passing away in the morning. For this have I hewed in Prophets, I have killed them in the words of my mouth: and thy judgements shall come forth as the light: because I would mercy, and not sacrifice: and the knowledge of God more than holocausts. But they as Adam have transgressed the covenant, there have they prevaricated against me. Galaad a city of them that work idol, supplanted with blood. And as it were the jaws of men that are robbers, partaker with the Priests, of them that in the way kill those that pass out of Sichem: because they have wrought wickedness. In the house of Israel I saw an horrible thing: there the fornications of Ephraim: Israel is contaminated. Yea and thou Juda put thee an harvest, when I shall convert the captivity of my people.</div>
