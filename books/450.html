To whom also our Lord gave beauty: because all this trimming did not depend of sensuality, but of virtue: and therefore our Lord amplified this beauty on her, that she might appear to all men's eyes of incomparable comeliness. She therefore laid upon her Abra a bottle of wine, and a vessel of oil, and polent, and dry figs, and bread, and cheese, and went forward.
