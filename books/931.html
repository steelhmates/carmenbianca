			<div class='roleText'>And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, propose a dark speech, and tell a parable to the house of Israel, and thou shalt say: Thus saith our Lord God: A great eagle with great wings, with a long reach of members, full of feathers, and of variety, came to Libanus, and took the marrow of the cedar. He plucked away the top of the boughs thereof: and transported it into the Land of Chanaan, in the city of merchants he did put it. And he took of the seed of the land, &amp; put it in the ground for seed, that it might fasten the root over many waters: he planted it in the overmost part of the earth. And when it had budded, it grew into a broad spreading vine of low stature, the boughs thereof looking toward it: and the roots thereof were under it. It became a vine then, and fructified into branches, and put forth shoots. And there was made another great eagle, with great wings, and many feathers: and behold this vine as it were spreading her roots towards it, stretched forth her branches to it, that she might water it from the beds of her spring. In a good ground upon many waters it was planted, that it might bring forth branches, &amp; bear fruit, that it might be into a great vine. Say: Thus saith our Lord God: shall it prosper then? Shall he not pluck up the roots thereof, &amp; strip off the fruits thereof, dry up all the branches of the spring thereof, &amp; it shall wither: &amp; not in a great arm, nor in much people, to pluck it up by the root? Behold it is planted: shall it prosper them? Shall it not be dried when the burning wind shall touch it, and wither in the beds of the spring thereof? And the word of our Lord was made to me saying: Say to the exasperating house: Know you not what these things do signify? Say: Behold the king of Babylon cometh into Jerusalem: and he shall take the king and the princes thereof, and shall bring them to himself into Babylon. And he shall take of the seed of the kingdom, and shall make a covenant with it, and shall take an oath of it. Yea and he shall take away the strong of the land, that it may be a low kingdom, &amp; not be elevated, but keep his covenant, and observe it. Who revolting from him sent messengers to Aegypt, that it would give him horses, and much people. What, shall he prosper, or get salvation that hath done these things? And he that broke the covenant, shall he escape? Live I, saith our Lord God: that in the place of the king that made him king, whose oath he made frustrate, and brake the covenant, that he had with him, in the midst of Babylon shall he die. And not in a great army, nor in much people shall Pharao make battle against him: in the casting up of a ramper, and in the building of bulwarks, to kill many souls. For he had despised the oath, that he might break the covenant, and behold he gave his hand, &amp; when he hath done all these things, he shall not escape. Therefore thus saith our Lord God: Live I, that the oath which he hath despised, and the covenant, that he transgressed, I will lay on his head. And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, and will judge him there in the prevarication, whereby he hath despised me. And all his fugitives with all their troop shall fall by the sword: and the residue shall be dispersed into every wind: and you shall know that I^ the Lord have spoken. Thus saith our Lord God: And I will take of the marrow of the high cedar, and will set it: of the top of the boughs thereof the tender one I will strip off, and will plant it upon a mountain high and eminent. On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it, and it shall shoot forth into a bud, and shall yield fruit, and it shall be into a great cedar: and all birds, and every fowl shall dwell under the shadow of the boughs thereof, and shall there make their nest. And all the trees of the country shall know, that I^ the Lord have humbled the high tree, &amp; exalted the low tree: and have dried the green tree, and have caused the dry tree to spring, I^ the Lord have spoken, and have done it.</div>
