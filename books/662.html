			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Praise ye our Lord from the heavens: praise ye him in the high places. Praise ye him all his Angels: praise ye him all his hosts: Praise ye him sun and moon: praise him all ye stars, and light. Praise him ye heavens of heavens: and the waters that are above the heavens, let them praise the name of our Lord. Because he said, and they were made: he commanded, and they were created. He established them for ever, and for ever and ever: he put a precept, and it shall not pass. Praise our Lord from the earth: ye dragons, and all depths. Fire, hail, snow, ice, spirit of storms: which do his word: Mountains, and all little hills: trees that bear fruit, and all cedars. Beasts, and all cattle: serpents, and feathered fowls: Kings of the earth, &amp; all peoples: Princes, and all judges of the earth. Young men and virgins: old with young let them praise the name of our Lord: because the name of him alone is exalted. The confession of him above heaven and earth: and he hath exalted the horn of his people. An hymn to all his saints: to the children of Israel a people approaching unto him. Alleluia.</div>
