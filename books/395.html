			<div class='roleText'>Twenty years old was Achaz when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: he did not right in the sight of our Lord as David his father, but walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, moreover also he did cast statues to Baalim. He it is that burnt incense to the Valebenennom, and he consecrated his sons in fire according to the rite of the nations, which our Lord slew in the coming of the children of Israel. He sacrificed also, &amp; burnt incense in the excelses, and on hills, and under every tree full of green leaves. And our Lord his God delivered him into the hands of the king of Syria, who struck him, and took a great prey out of his Kingdom, and brought into Damascus: to the hands also of the king of Israel was he delivered, &amp; stricken with a great plague. And Phacee the son of Romelia slew of Juda an hundred twenty thousand in one day, all men of war: for that they had forsaken our Lord the God of their fathers. At that time Zechri a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maasias the king's son, and Ezricam the governor of his house, Elcana also second from the king. And the children of Israel took of their brethren two hundred thousand of women, of boys, and of wenches, and an infinite prey: &amp; they brought it into Samaria. At that time there was a Prophet of our Lord, named Oded: who going forth to meet the army coming into Samaria, said to them: Behold our Lord the God of your fathers being angry against Juda, hath delivered them into your hands, and you have slain them cruelly, so that your cruelty did reach to heaven. Moreover the children of Juda and Jerusalem you will subdue unto you for bondmen and bond women, which needeth not to be done: for you have sinned hereupon to our Lord your God. But hear ye my counsel, and carry back the captives, that you have brought of your brethren, because the great fury of our Lord hangeth over you. There stood therefore Princes of the children of Ephraim, Azarias the son of Johanan, Barachias the son of Mosollomoth, Ezechias the son of Sellum, and Amasa the son of Hadali, against them that came out of the battle, and they said to them: You shall not bring in the captives hither, lest we sin to our Lord. Why will you add upon our sins, and heap up old offences? For it is a great sin, and the anger of the fury of our Lord hangeth over Israel. And the men of war dismist the prey, and all the things that they had taken, before the Princes and all the multitude. And the men, whom we mentioned above, stood, and taking the captives, and all that were naked they clothed and shod them with the spoils: and when they had clothed and refreshed them with meat and drink, &amp; anointed them because of their labour, and had looked carefully to them: as many as could not walk, and were of a weak body, they set on beasts, and brought them to Jericho the City of palm trees to their brethren, and themselves returned into Samaria. At that time king Achaz sent to the king of the Assyrians asking help. And the Idumeans came and struck many of Juda, and took a great prey. The Philisthiims also were spread abroad by the cities of the champion, and toward the South of Juda: and they took Bethsames, and Aialon, and Gaderoth, Socho also, and Thamnan, and Gamzo, with their villages, and dwelt in them. For our Lord had humbled Juda because of Achaz the king of Juda, for that he had made it naked of help, and had contemned our Lord. And he brought against him Theglathphalnasar the king of the Assyrians, who also afflicted him, and spoiled him no man resisting. Therefore Achaz spoiling the house of our Lord, and the house of the kings, and of the Princes gave gifts to the king of the Assyrians, and yet it did nothing profit him. Moreover also in the time of his distress he increased contempt against our Lord, king Achaz himself by himself, immolated victims to the gods of Damascus that struck him, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>The gods of the kings of Syria do help them, whom I will pacify with hosts, and they will aid me, whereas on the contrary part they were his ruin, and all Israel's. Achaz therefore having spoiled all the vessels of the house of God, and broken them, shut the gates of the temple of God, and made him altars in all the corners of Jerusalem. In all the cities also of Juda he built altars to burn frankincense, and he provoked to wrath our Lord the God of his fathers. But the rest of his words, &amp; all his works the first and the last are written in the Book of the kings of Juda and Israel. And Achaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of Jerusalem: for they received him not into the sepulchres of the kings of Israel. And Ezechias his son reigned for him.</div>
