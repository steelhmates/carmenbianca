			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of David. Our Lord said to my Lord: Sit on my right hand: till I make thine enemies, the foot-stool of thy feet. Our Lord will send forth the rod of thy strength from Sion: rule thou in the midst of thine enemies. With thee the beginning in the day of thy strength: in the brightness of holy things: from the womb before the day star I begat thee. Our Lord sware, and it shall not repent him: Thou art a Priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedech. Our Lord on thy right hand hath broken kings in the day of his wrath. He shall judge in nations, he shall fill ruins, he shall crush the heads in the land of many. Of the torrent in the way he shall drink: therefore shall he exalt the head.</div>
