			<div class='roleText'>How good a thing is it to rebuke, rather than to be angry, and not to hinder him that confesseth in prayer! The concupiscence of an eunuch shall deflower a young-maid: so he that by violence doth unjust judgement. How good a thing is it being rebuked to shew repentance! For so thou shalt avoid willful sin. There is that holdeth his peace, which is found wise: and there is that is odious, he which is malapert to speak. There is that holdeth his peace having not understanding to speak: and there is that holdeth his peace, knowing the time of fit opportunity. A wise man will hold his peace until a time: but a wanton, and the unwise will not observe time. He that useth many words, shall hurt his own soul: &amp; he that taketh authority to himself unjustly, shall be hated. There is proceeding in evils to a man without discipline, and there is finding to loss. There is a gift, that is not profitable: and there is a gift, the reward whereof is double. There is debasing because of glory: and there is that from humility shall lift up the head. There is that redeemeth many things for a small price, and restoreth the same seven-fold. A man wise in words shall make himself beloved: but the graces of fools shall be poured out. The gift of the unwise shall not be profitable for thee: for his eyes are seven-fold. He will give few things, and upbraid many: and the opening of his mouth is an inflammation. Today a man lendeth, and tomorrow he asketh it again: such a man is odious. A fool shall have no friend, and there shall be not thank to his goods. For they that eat his bread, are of a false tongue. How often, and how many will laugh him to scorn? For he doth not distribute with right understanding, that which was to be had: in like manner also that which was not to be had. The slipping of a false tongue, as he that falleth on the pavement: so the falls of the evil shall come hastily. A man without grace is as a vain fable, it shall be continual in the mouth of them that are without discipline. A parable out of a fool's mouth shall be rejected: for he doth not speak it in his time. There is that is forbid to sin for poverty, and in his rest he shall be pricked. There is that will destroy his soul for shamefastness, and by an unwise person he will destroy it: and by acception of person he will destroy himself. There is that for shamefastness promiseth to his friend, and hath gotten an enemy of him for naught. Lying is a wicked reproach in a man, and in the mouth of men without discipline it shall be continually. Better is a thief, than the continual custom of a lying man, but both shall inherit perdition. The manners of lying men are without honour: and their confusion is with them without intermission. A wise man in his words shall utter himself, and a prudent man shall please great persons. He that tilleth his land, shall make an high heap of corn: and who so worketh justice, he shall be exalted: and he that pleaseth great men, shall avoid iniquity. Presents &amp; gifts blind the eyes of judges, and as one dumb in the mouth turneth away their chastisements. Wisdom hid, and treasure not seen: what profit is there in both? Better is he that concealeth his foolishness, than the man that hideth his wisdom.</div>
