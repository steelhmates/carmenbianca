			<div class='roleText'>Times are not hid from the Omnipotent: but they that know him, know not his days. Some have transferred bounds, spoiled flocks, &amp; fed them. They have driven away the ass of pupils, and have taken away the widow's oxe for a pledge. They have subverted the way of the poor, and have oppressed together the meek of the earth. Others as wild asses in the desert go forth to their work: watching to the prey, do prepare bread for their children. They reap the field that is not theirs, and gather the grapes of his vineyard, whom by violence they have oppressed. They send men away naked taking away their cloths, which have no covering in the cold. Whom the showers of the mountains do wash, &amp; not having a covert, they embrace stones. They did violence spoiling the pupils, &amp; the common poor people they spoiled. From the naked &amp; them that go without clothing, and the hungry they have taken away the ears of corn. They have rested the noontide among their heaps, which having trodden the wine presses are a thirst. Out of the cities they have made men to mourn, and the soul of the wounded hath cried, &amp; God doth not suffer it to pass unrevenged: They have been rebellious to the light, they have not known his ways, neither did they return by his paths. At the very break of day the murderer riseth, he killeth the needy, and the poor man: but by night he will be as a thief. The eye of the adulterer observeth darkness, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Eye shall not see me: and he will cover his face. He diggeth through houses in the dark, as in the day they had appointed with themselves, and they have not known the light. If suddenly the morning shall appear, they think it the shadow of death: and they walk so in darkness as it were in light. He is light above the face of the water: cursed be his portion in the earth, neither walk he by the way of the vineyards. Let him pass from snow waters to exceeding heat, and his sin even unto hell. Let mercy forget him: worms his sweetness: be he not in remembrance, but be he broken in pieces as an unfruitful tree. For he hath fed the barren, and her that beareth not, and to the widow he hath not done good. He hath pulled down the strong in his strength and when he shall stand, he will not credit his life. God hath given him place for penance, and he abuseth it unto pride: but his eyes be upon his ways. They are elevated for a little, and shall not stand, and shall be humbled as all things, and shall be taken away, and as the tops of the ears of corn they shall be broken. And if it be not so, who can reprove me that I have lied, and set my words before God?</div>
