			<div class='roleText'>AND when morning was come; all the chief Priests and ancients of the people consulted together against JESUS, that they might put him to death. And they brought him bound and delivered him to Ponce Pilate the President. Then Judas that betrayed him, seeing that he was condemned, repenting him, returned the thirty silver pieces to the chief Priests and ancients, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>It is not lawful to cast them into the Corbana, because it is the price of blood. And after they had consulted together, they bought with them the potter's field, to be a burying place for strangers. For this cause that field was called Haceldama, that is, the field of blood, even to this present day. Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremie the Prophet, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Art thou the King of the Jews? JESUS saith to him: Thou sayest. And when he was accused of the chief Priests and Ancients, he answered nothing. Then Pilate saith to him: Doest thou not hear how many testimonies they allege against thee? And he answered him not to any word: so that the President did marvel exceedingly. And upon the solemn day the President had accustomed to release unto the People one prisoner, whom they would. And he had then a notorious prisoner, that was called Barabbas. They therefore being gathered together, Pilate said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Have thou nothing to do with that just man. For I have suffered many things this day in my sleep for him. But the chief Priests and ancients persuaded the people, that they should ask Barabbas, and make JESUS away. And the President answering, said to them: Whether will you of the two to be released unto you? But they said, Barabbas. Pilate saith to them: What shall I do then with JESUS that is called Christ? They say all: Let him be crucified. The President said to them: Why^ what evil hath he done? But they cried the more, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>His blood be upon us, and upon our children. Then he released to them Barabbas, and having scourged JESUS, delivered him unto them for to be crucified. Then the President's soldiers taking JESUS into the Palace, gathered together unto him the whole band: and stripping him, put a scarlet cloak about him. and platting a crown of thorns, put it upon his head, and a reed in his right hand. And bowing the knee before him, they mocked him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Hail King of the Jews. And spitting upon him, they took the reed, and smote his head. And after they had mocked him, they took off the cloak from him, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to crucify him. And in going they found a man of Cyrene, named Simon: him they forced to take up his Cross. And they came into the place that is called Golgotha, which is, the place of Calvary. And they gave him wine to drink mingled with gall. And when he had tasted, he would not drink. And after they had crucified him; they divided his garments, casting lots; that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>They divided my garments among them; and upon my vesture they did cast lots. And they sat and watched him. And they put over his head his cause written: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS. Then were crucified with him two thieves; one on the right hand, and one on the left. And they that passed by, blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Vah, thou that destroyest the Temple of God and in three days doest re-edify it; save thine own self: if thou be the Son of God, come down from the Cross. In like manner also the chief Priests with the Scribes and ancients mocking, said: He saved other; himself he cannot save: if he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the Cross, and we will believe him. He trusted in God; let him now deliver him if he will: for he said, that I am the Son of God. And the self same thing the thieves also that were crucified with him, reproached him withal. And from the sixth hour, there was darkness made upon the whole earth, until the ninth hour. And about the ninth hour JESUS cried with a mighty voice, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let be, let us see whether Elias come to deliver him. And JESUS again crying with a mighty voice, yielded up the ghost. And behold the veil of the Temple was rent in two pieces, from the top even to the bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent, And the graves were opened: and many bodies of the saints that had slept, rose. And they going forth out of the graves after his resurrection, came into the holy city; and appeared to many. And the Centurion and they that were with him watching JESUS, having seen the earth-quake and the things that were done, were sore afraid, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Indeed this was the Son of God. And there were there many women a far off, which had followed JESUS from Galilee, ministering unto him: among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the Sons of Zebedee. And when it was evening, there came a certain rich man of Arimathaea, named Joseph, who also himself was disciple to JESUS. He went to Pilate, and asked the body of JESUS. Then Pilate commanded that the body should be delivered. And Joseph taking the body, wrapt it in clean sindon, &amp; laid it in his own new monument, which he had hewed out in a rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the monument, &amp; went his way. And there was there Mary Magdalene, &amp; the other Mary, sitting over against the sepulchre. And the next day, which is after the Parasceve, the chief Priests and the Pharisees came together to Pilate, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Sir, we have remembered, that that seducer said yet living, After three days I will rise again. Command therefore the sepulchre to be kept until the third day; lest perhaps his Disciples come, and steal him, &amp; say to the people, he is risen from the dead: and the last error shall be worse than the first. Pilate said to them: You have a guard: go, guard it as you know. And they departing, made the sepulchre sure; sealing up the stone, with watchmen.</div>
