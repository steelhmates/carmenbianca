			<div class='roleText'>Beseleel therefore, and Ooliab, and every wise man, to whom our Lord gave wisdom and understanding, to know how to work artificially, made the things that are necessary for the uses of the Sanctuary, and which our Lord did command. And when Moyses had called them, and every cunning man, to whom our Lord had given wisdom, and such as of their own accord had offered themselves to the making of the work, he delivered all the donaries of the children of Israel unto them. Who being earnest about the work, the people daily in the morning did offer their vows. Whereupon the artificers being constrained to come, said to Moyses: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>And so they ceased from offering gifts, because the things that were offered did suffice and were over-much. And all the wise hearted men, to accomplish the work of the tabernacle, made ten curtains of twisted silk, and hyacinth, and purple, and scarlet twice dyed, with varied work, and the art of embroidering: of which one had in length twenty eight cubits, and in breadth four: there was one measure of all the curtains. And he joined five curtains, one to another, and the other five he coupled to themselves one with another. He made also loops of hyacinth in the edge of one curtain on either side, and in the edge of the other curtain in like manner, that the loops might meet one against another, and might be joined each with other. Whereupon also he did cast fifty rings of gold, that might catch the loops of the curtains, and might be made one tabernacle. He made also eleven curtains of goats hair to cover the roof of the tabernacle. one curtain in length had thirty cubits, &amp; in breadth four cubits: all the curtains were of one measure: of which five he joined apart, &amp; the other six apart. And he made fifty loops in the edge of one curtain, and fifty in the edge of another curtain, that they might be joined one to another. And fifty buckles of brass wherewith the roof might be knit together, that of all the curtains there might be made one covering. He made also a cover for the tabernacle of rams' skins dyed red: &amp; another cover over that of janthine skins. He made also the boards of the tabernacle of the wood setim standing. The length of one board was ten cubits: and the breadth contained one cubit &amp; an half. There were two mortises throughout every board, that one might be joined to the other. So made he in all the boards of the tabernacle. Of the which twenty were at the south side against the south, with forty feet of silver. Two feet were put under one board on either side of the corners, where the mortises of the sides end in the corners. At that side also of the tabernacle, that looked toward the north, he made twenty boards, with forty feet of silver, two feet for every board. But against the west, to wit, at that side of the tabernacle, which looketh to the sea, he made six boards, and two other at each corner of the tabernacle behind: which were also joined from beneath unto the top, &amp; they grew together into one connexion. So he made on either side at the corners: that there were in all eight boards, and had sixteen feet of silver, to wit, two feet under every board. He made also bars of the wood setim, five to hold together the boards of one side of the tabernacle, and five other to join together the boards of the other side: and besides these, five other bars at the west side of the tabernacle against the sea. He made also another bar, that might come by the midst of the boards from corner unto corner. And the boardwork itself he plated with gold. And their rings he made of gold, through which the bars might be drawn: the which also themselves he covered with plates of gold. He made also a veil of hyacinth, and purple, scarlet, and twisted silk, with embroidered work, varied and distinguished: and four pillars of the wood setim, which with their heads he plated with gold, casting their feet of silver. He made also a hanging in the entry of the tabernacle of hyacinth, purple, scarlet, and twisted silk, with the work of an embroiderer: and five pillars with their heads, which he covered with gold, and their feet he did cast of brass.</div>
