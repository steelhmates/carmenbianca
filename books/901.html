			<div class='roleText'>The word that our Lord hath spoken of Babylon, and the Land of the Chaldees in the hand of Jeremy the Prophet. Declare among the Gentiles, and make it heard, lift up a sign: proclaim and conceal it not; say: Babylon is taken, Bel is confounded, Merodach is overcome, their sculptiles are confounded, their idols are overcome. Because a nation is come up against them from the North, which shall bring her Land into desolation: and there shall be none to dwell therein, from man even to beast, and they are removed, and gone away. In those days, and in that time saith our Lord, the children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together: walking and weeping they shall hasten, and shall seek the Lord their God. Into Sion they shall ask the way, their faces hitherward. They shall come, and shall be joined to our Lord by an everlasting covenant, which shall by no oblivion be abolished. My people is become a lost flock, their Pastors have seduced them, &amp; have made them wander in the mountains: they have passed from mountain to hill, they have forgotten their couch. All that found them, have eaten them: and their enemies said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>We have not sinned: because they have sinned to the Lord the beauty of Justice, and to the Lord the expectation of their fathers. Depart out of the midst of Babylon, and go forth out of the land of the Chaldees: and be ye as kids before the flock. Because lo I raise up, and will bring into Babylon an assembly of great nations from the land of the North: and they shall be prepared against her, and thereby she shall be taken: his arrow as a valiant man's that is a killer, shall not return void. And Chaldea shall be for a prey: all that waste it shall be filled, saith our Lord. Because you rejoice, and speak great things, spoiling mine inheritance: because you are poured out as calves upon the grass, and you have bellowed as bulls. Your Mother is confounded exceedingly, and made even with the dust, she that bare you: behold she shall be the last among the Gentiles, desolate, without access, and dry. Of the wrath of our Lord it shall not be inhabited, but shall be brought wholly into desolation: every one that shall pass by Babylon, shall be astonished, and shall hiss upon all the plagues thereof. Be prepared against Babylon round about all ye that bend bow; overthrow her, spare not arrows: because she hath sinned to our Lord. Cry against her, she hath given the hand every-where, her foundations are fallen, her walls are destroyed, because it is the vengeance of our Lord. Take vengeance of her: as she hath done, so do to her. Destroy the sower out of Babylon, and him that holdeth the sickle in the harvest time: at the face of the sword of the dove every man shall return to his people, and every one shall fly to his own land. Israel is a flock dispersed, lions have cast him out: first the king of Assur did eat him: last this Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon hath spoiled his bones. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will visit the king of Babylon and his land, as I have visited the king of Assur: and I will bring Israel again to his habitation: and Carmel shall be fed, and Basan, and in mount Ephraim, and Galaad his soul shall be filled. In those days, and in that time, saith our Lord, the iniquity of Israel shall be sought, and it shall not be: and the sin of Juda, and it shall not be found: because I will be propitious to them, whom I shall leave. Ascend upon the land of them that rule, and visit upon the inhabitants thereof, destroy, and kill the things that are behind them, saith our Lord: and do according to all things that I have commanded thee. A voice of battle in the land, and great destruction. How is the hammer of the whole earth broken, and destroyed? How is Babylon turned into a desert among the nations? I have snared thee, and thou art taken Babylon, and thou knewest it not: thou art found &amp; apprehended, because thou hast provoked our Lord. Our Lord hath opened his treasure, and brought forth the vessels of his wrath: because the Lord the God of hosts hath a work in the land of the Chaldees. Come ye unto her from the uttermost borders, open that they may go forth that shall tread her down: take the stones out of the way, &amp; bring it into heaps, &amp; kill her: neither let there be any thing left. Destroy all her valiants, let them descend into slaughter: woe unto them, because their day is come, the time of their visitation. A voice of them that fly, and of them that have escaped out of the land of Babylon: to tell in Sion the revenge of the Lord our God, the revenge of his temple. Declare ye against Babylon to very many, to all that bend bow: stand together against her round about, and let none escape: repay her according to her work: according to all things, that she hath done, do ye to her: because she is erected against our Lord, against the holy one of Israel. Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets: and all her men of war shall hold their peace in that day, saith our Lord. Behold I to thee thou proud one, saith our Lord the God of hosts: because thy day is come, the time of thy visitation. And the proud shall fall, and tumble down, and there shall be none to raise him up: and I will kindle a fire in his cities, and it shall devour all things round about him. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: The children of Israel, and the children of Juda sustain calumny together: all that have taken them, hold them, they will not let them go. Their strong redeemer, the Lord of hosts is his name, in judgement will defend their cause, to terrify the land, and to stir up the inhabitants of Babylon. The sword to the Chaldees, saith our Lord, &amp; to the inhabitants of Babylon, and to her Princes, and to her wise men. The sword to her diviners, who shall be foolish: the sword to her valiants, who shall be afraid. The sword to his horses, and to his chariots, and to all the common people, that is in the midst of her: and they shall be as women: the sword to her treasures, which shall be spoiled. There shall be drought upon her waters, and they shall be dried up: because it is a land of sculptiles, and they glory in monstrous things. Therefore shall the dragons dwell with the foolish murderers: and the ostriches shall dwell in it: and it shall no more be inhabited for ever, neither shall it be built even to generation and generation. As our Lord overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and the neighbours thereof, saith our Lord: there shall no man dwell there, &amp; son of man shall not inhabit it. Behold a people cometh from the North, and a great nation, and many kings shall rise from the ends of the earth. They shall take bow and shield: they are cruel &amp; unmerciful: their voice shall sound as the sea, and they shall mount upon horses: as a man prepared to battle against thee, o daughter of Babylon. The king of Babylon hath heard the same of them, and his hands are dissolved: anguish hath caught him, sorrow as a woman in travail. Behold as a lion he shall come up from the pride of Jordan to the strong beautifulness: because I will make him run suddenly to her: and who shall be a chosen one, whom I may appoint over her? For who is like to me? And who shall abide me? And who is this Pastor, that can resist my countenance? Therefore hear ye the counsel of our Lord, which he hath conceived in his mind against Babylon: and his cogitations, which he hath thought upon the land of the Chaldees: Unless the little ones of the flocks shall pluck them down, unless their habitation shall be destroyed with them. At the voice of the captivity of Babylon the earth is moved, and the cry is heard amongst the Nations.</div>
