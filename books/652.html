			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, a Psalm of David. Lord thou hast proved me, and hast known me: thou hast known my sitting down, and my rising up. Thou hast understood my cogitations far off: my path, and my cord thou hast searched out. And thou hast foreseen all my ways: because there is not a word in my tongue. Behold, o Lord, thou hast known all the last things, &amp; them of old: thou hast formed me, and hast put thy hand upon me. Thy knowledge is become marvelous of me: it is made great, and I cannot reach to it. Whither shall I go from thy spirit? And whither shall I fly from thy face? If I shall ascend into heaven, thou art there: if I descend into hell, thou art present. If I shall take my wings early, and dwell in the extreme parts of the sea. Certes thither also shall thy hand conduct me: and thy right hand shall hold me. And I said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Perhaps darkness shall tread over me: and the night is mine illumination in my delights. For darkness shall not be darkened from thee, and the night shall be lightened as the day: as the darkness thereof, so also the light thereof. Because thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast received me from my mother's womb. I will confess to thee, because thou art terribly magnified: thy works are marvelous, &amp; my soul knoweth exceedingly. My bone is not hid from thee, which thou madest in secret: and my substance in the lower parts of the earth. Mine imperfection thine eyes have seen, &amp; in thy book all shall be written: days shall be formed, &amp; no man in them. But to me thy friends, o God, are become honourable exceedingly: their principality is exceedingly strengthened. I will number them, and they shall be multiplied above the sand: I rose up and I am yet with thee. If thou shalt kill sinners, o God: ye men of blood depart from me. Because you say in thought: they shall receive thy cities in vain. Did not I hate them that hate thee, o Lord: and pined away because of thine enemies? with perfect hatred did I hate them: they are become enemies to me. Prove me, o God, and know my heart: examine me, and know my paths. And see, if the way of iniquity be in me: and conduct me in the everlasting way.</div>
