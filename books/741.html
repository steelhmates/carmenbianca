			<div class='roleText'>Do not evils, and they shall not apprehend thee. Depart from the wicked, &amp; evil shall fail from thee. Son, sow not evils in the furrows of justice, &amp; thou shalt not reap them sevenfold. Seek not of the Lord chief principality, nor of the king the chair of honour. Justify not thy-self before God, because he is the knower of the heart: and before the king desire not to seem wise. Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou be able by power to break iniquities: lest perhaps thou fear the face of the mighty, and put a scandal in thine equity. Sin not against the multitude of a city, neither thrust thy-self into the people, nor bind together double sins: for neither in one shalt thou be free from punishment. Be not faint-hearted in thy mind: despise not to pray, and to give alms. Say not: In the multitude of my gifts God will have respect, and when I offer to God most high, he will receive my gifts. Laugh not a man to scorn in the bitterness of his soul: for there is that humbleth and exalteth, God the overseer of all. Plow not a lie against thy brother: neither do thou likewise against thy friend. Be not willing to make any lie: for the custom thereof is not good. Be not full of words in a multitude of ancients, and iterate not a word in thy speech. Hate not laborious works, and husbandry created of the Highest. Count not thyself in the multitude of men without discipline. Be mindful of wrath, because it will not slack. Humble thy spirit very much: because the vengeance of the flesh of the impious, is fire and the worm. Do not prevaricate against thy friend deferring money, nor despise thy dearest brother for gold. Depart not from a wise and good woman, which thou hast gotten in the fear of our Lord: for the grace of her bashfulness is above gold. Hurt not the servant that worketh in truth, nor the hired man that giveth his soul. Let a wise servant be beloved of thee as thy soul, defraud him not of liberty, nor leave him needy. Hast thou cattle? Look well to them: and if they be profitable, let them continue with thee. Hast thou children? Instruct them, &amp; bow them from their childhood. Hast thou daughters? Keep their body, and shew not thy countenance merry towards them. Bestow thy daughter, and thou shalt do a great work, and give her to a wise man. If thou have a wife according to thy soul, cast her not off: and to her that is hateful commit not thyself. With thy whole heart honour thy father, and forget not the groanings of thy mother: remember that thou hadst not been born but by them: and recompense them, as they also thee. In all thy soul fear our Lord, and sanctify his Priests. With all thy strength love him that made thee: &amp; forsake not his ministers. Honour God with all thy soul, and honour the Priests, and purge thyself with the arms. Give them the portion, as it is commanded thee, of the first fruits and purgation: and of thy negligence purge thyself with few. The gift of thine arms and the sacrifice of sanctification thou shalt offer to our Lord, and the first of holy things: and to the poor stretch out thine hand, that thy propitiation may be perfected, and thy blessing. The grace of a gift is in the sight of all the living, and from the dead stay not grace. Want not in consolation to them that weep, and walk with them that mourn. Be not loath to visit the sick: for by these things thou shalt be confirmed in love. In all thy works remember thy later ends, and thou wilt not sin for ever.</div>
