			<div class='roleText'>Woe to you that are rich in Sion, and have confidence in the mountain of Samaria: ye great men, heads of the peoples, going stately into the house of Israel. Pass ye into Chalane, and see, and go ye thence into Emath the great: &amp; descend into Geth of the Palestines, and to all the best kingdoms of these: if their border be larger than your border. You that are separated unto the evil day: &amp; approach to the throne of iniquity. You that sleep in beds of ivory, and play the wantons in your couches: that eat the lamb out of the flock, &amp; calves out of the midst of the herd. You that sing to the voice of the psalter: as David they have thought themselves to have the instruments of song. That drink wine in phials, and are anointed with the best ointment: and they suffered nothing upon the contrition of Joseph. Wherefore now they shall go in the head of them, that go in transmigration: and the faction of the wantons shall be taken away. The Lord God hath sworn by his soul, saith our Lord the God of hosts: I detest the pride of Jacob, and I hate his houses, and I will deliver up the city with the inhabitants thereof. And if there shall be left ten men in one house, they also shall die. And his kinsman shall take him up, and shall burn him, that he may carry the bones out of the house: and he shall say to him, that is in the inner parts of the house: Is there yet with thee? And he shall answer: There is an end. And he shall say to him: Hold thy peace, and remember not the name of our Lord. Because lo our Lord hath commanded, &amp; he will strike the greater house with ruins, &amp; the lesser house with clefts. Why^ can horses run upon rocks, or can there be ploughing with buffles? Because you have turned judgement into bitterness, and the fruit of justice into wormwood? Which rejoice in things of naught: which say: Why have not we taken unto us horns in our own strength? For behold I will raise up from you o house of Israel, saith our Lord the God of hosts, a nation: and they shall destroy you from the entrance of Emath, even to the torrent of the desert.</div>
