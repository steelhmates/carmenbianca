			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, understanding to David, When Doeg the Idumeite came and told Saul: David is come into the house of Achimelech. Why doest thou glory in malice, which are mighty in iniquity? All the day hath thy tongue thought injustice: as a sharp razor thou hast done guile. Thou hast loved malice more than benignity: iniquity rather than to speak equity. Thou hast loved all words of precipitation, a deceitful tongue. Therefore will God destroy thee for ever, he will pluck thee out, &amp; remove thee out of thy tabernacle: &amp; thy root out of the land of the living. The just shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at him, and they shall say: Behold the man, that hath not put God for his helper. But hath hoped in the multitude of his riches, and hath prevailed in his vanity. But I as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God for ever: and for ever and ever. I will confess to thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I will expect thy name, because it is good in the sight of thy Saints.</div>
