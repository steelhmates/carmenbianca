And James of Zebedee, and John the brother of James; and he called their names, Boanerges, which is, the sons of thunder. And Andrew and Philippe, and Barthlemew and Matthew, and Thomas and James of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus and Simon Cananaeus, and Judas Iscariote, who also betrayed him. And they come to a house; and the multitude resorteth together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread. And when his^ had heard of it, they went forth to lay hands on him.
