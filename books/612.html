			<div class='roleText'>A psalm to David himself. Our Lord hath reigned, let peoples be angry: he that sitteth upon the Cherubs, let the earth be moved. Our Lord great in Sion: and high above all peoples. Let them confess to thy great name: because it is terrible and holy. And the honour of the King loveth judgment. Thou hast prepared directions: thou hast done judgment and justice in Jacob. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore his foot-stool: because it is holy. Moyses and Aaron in his Priests: and Samuel among them that invocate his name: They invocated our Lord and he heard them: in a pillar of a cloud he spake to them. They kept his testimonies, &amp; the precept which he gave them. O Lord our God thou heardest them: God thou wast propitious to them, and taking vengeance upon all their inventions. Exalt ye the Lord our God, and adore ye in his holy mount: because the Lord our God is holy.</div>
