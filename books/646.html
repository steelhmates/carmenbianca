			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle of David. Behold how good and how pleasant a thing it is, for brethren to dwell in one. As ointment on the head, which ran down upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, which ran down unto the hem of his garment. As the dew of Hermon, which runneth down upon mount Sion. Because there hath our Lord commanded blessing, and life even for ever.</div>
