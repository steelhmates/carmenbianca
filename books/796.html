			<div class='roleText'>And a rod shall come forth of the root of Jesse, and a flower shall rise up out of his root. And the Spirit of our Lord shall rest upon him: the spirit of wisdom, and understanding, the spirit of counsel, and strength, the spirit of knowledge, and piety, and the spirit of the fear of our Lord shall replenish him. He shall not judge according to the sight of the eyes, nor rebuke according to the hearing of the ears. But he shall judge the poor in justice, &amp; shall rebuke in equity for the mild of the earth: and he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the spirit of his lips he shall kill the impious. And justice shall be the girdle of his loins: and faith the girdle of his reins. The wolf shall dwell with the lamb: and the leopard shall lie with the kid, the calf, and lion, and sheep shall abide together, a little child shall lead them. The calf, and the bear shall feed: their young ones shall rest together: and the lion shall eat straw as it were an oxe. And the infant from the breast shall be delighted upon the hole of the asp: and he that is weaned, shall thrust his hand into the hole of the cockatrice. They shall not hurt, and they shall not kill in all my holy mountain, because the earth is replenished with the knowledge of our Lord, as the covering waters of the sea. In that day the root of Jesse, that standeth for a sign of peoples, him the nations shall beseech, and his sepulchre shall be glorious. And it shall be in that day: our Lord shall put to his hand the second time to possess the remnant of his people, which shall be left of the Assyrians, and of Aegypt, and of Phethros, and of Aethiopia, and of Aelam, and of Sennaar, and of Emath, and of the islands of the sea. And he shall lift up a sign unto the nations, and shall assemble together the fugitives of Israel, and shall gather the dispersed of Juda from the four quarters of the earth. And the emulation of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the enemies of Juda shall perish: Ephraim shall not envy Juda, &amp; Juda shall not fight against Ephraim. And they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philisthims by the sea, they together shall spoil the children of the East: Idumea, and Moab the precept of their hand, and the children of Ammon shall be obedient. And our Lord shall make desolate the tongue of the sea of Aegypt, and shall lift up his hand over the river in the strength of his spirit: and he shall strike him in his seven streams, so that they may pass through it with shoes. And there shall be a way to the remnant of my people, which shall be left of the Assyrians: as there was to Israel in the day, that he came up out of the Land of Aegypt.</div>
