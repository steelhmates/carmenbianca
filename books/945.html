			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the third month, the first of the month, the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, say to Pharao the king of Aegypt, and to his people: To whom art thou made like in thy greatness? Behold Assur as it were a Cedar in Libanus, fair of boughs, &amp; thick of leaves, and high of height, &amp; the top thereof is elevated among the thick boughs. The waters have nourished him, the depth hath exalted him, the rivers thereof ran out round about the roots thereof, and he sent forth her rivers to all the trees of the country. Therefore was his height elevated above all the trees of the country, and his groves were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters. And when he had spread forth his shadow, in his boughs all the fowls of the heaven made nests, and under his leaves all beasts of the forests engendered, and under his shadow dwelt the assembly of very many nations. And he was most fair in his greatness, and in the enlarging of his groves: for his root was near many waters. The cedars were not higher than he in the paradise of God, the fir-trees matched not his top, &amp; the plane-trees were not equal to his boughs: no tree of the paradise of God was likened to him, and to his beauty. Because I made him beautiful, and with many and thick boughs: and all the trees of pleasure, that were in the paradise of God, did emulate him. Therefore thus saith our Lord God: For that he is extolled in height, and hath given his top green and thick, and his heart is elevated in his height: I have delivered him into the hands of the strongest of the nations, doing he shall do to him: according to his impiety I have cast him out. And aliens, and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him down, and shall throw him forth upon the mountains, and in all valleys his boughs shall fall, and his groves shall be broken on all rocks of the land: and all the peoples of the earth shall depart from his shadow, and shall leave him. In his ruin dwelt all the fowls of heaven, and in his boughs were all the beasts of the field. For which cause there shall not be elevated in their height all the trees of the waters, neither shall they put their highness among the woody and thick ones, neither shall they stand in their height, all that are watered with waters: because they are all delivered into death to the lowest earth in the midst of the children of men, to them that go down into the Lake. Thus saith our Lord God: In the day that he went down to hell, I brought in mourning, I covered him with the depth: and I stayed his rivers, and kept in many waters: Libanus was made sad upon him, &amp; all the trees of the field were shaken. At the sound of his ruin I moved the Gentiles, when I brought him down to hell with them, that descended into the lake: &amp; all the trees of pleasure goodly &amp; glorious in Libanus, all that were watered with waters, were comforted in the lowest earth. For they also shall go down with him to hell to the slain by the sword: &amp; the arm of every one shall sit under his shadow in the midst of the nations. To whom art thou likened, o thou noble and lofty among the trees of pleasure? Behold thou art brought down with the trees of pleasure to the lowest earth: in the midst of the uncircumcised shalt thou sleep, with them that are slain by the sword, the same is Pharao, and all his multitude, saith our Lord God.</div>
