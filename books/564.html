			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, a Psalm of David, when Nathan the Prophet came to him, after that he had sinned with Bethsabee. Have mercy on me, o God, according to thy great mercy. And according to the multitude of thy commiserations, take away mine iniquity. Wash me more amply from mine iniquity: &amp; cleanse me from my sin. Because I do know mine iniquity: and my sin is before me always. To thee only have I sinned, and have done evil before thee: that thou mayst be justified in thy words, and mayst overcome when thou art judged. For behold I was conceived in iniquities: &amp; my mother conceived me in sins. For behold thou hast loved truth: the uncertain and hidden things of thy wisdom thou hast made manifest to me. Thou shalt sprinkle me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed: thou shalt wash me, and I shall be made whiter than snow. To my hearing thou shalt give joy and gladness, and the bones humbled shall rejoice. Turn away thy face from my sins: and wipe away all mine iniquities. Create a clean heart in me, o God: and renew a right spirit in my bowels. Cast me not away from thy face: and thy Holy spirit take not from me. Render unto me the joy of thy salvation? And confirm me with the principal spirit. I will teach the unjust thy ways: and the impious shall be converted to thee. Deliver me from bloods, o God, the God of my salvation: and my tongue shall exult thy justice. Lord thou wilt open my lips: &amp; my mouth shall shew forth thy praise. Because if thou wouldest have had sacrifice, I had verily given it: with holocausts thou wilt not be delighted. A sacrifice to God is an afflicted spirit: a contrite and humbled heart, o God, thou wilt not despise. Deal favourably, o Lord, in thy good will with Sion: that the walls of Jerusalem may be built up. Then shall thou accept sacrifice of justice, oblations, &amp; holocausts: then shall they lay calves upon thine altar.</div>
