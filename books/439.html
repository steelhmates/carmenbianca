			<div class='roleText'>Thou art great Lord for ever, and thy Kingdom world without end: because thou scourgest, and savest: leadest down to hell, and bringest back again: and there is none that may escape thy hand. Confess to our Lord ye children of Israel, and in the sight of the Gentiles praise him: because he hath therefore dispersed you among the gentiles, which know not him, that you may declare his marvelous works, and make them know, that there is no other God omnipotent besides him. He hath chastised us for our iniquities: and he will save us for his mercy. Behold therefore what he hath done with us, and with fear &amp; trembling confess ye to him: and extol the King of the worlds in your works. And I in the land of my captivity will confess to him: because he hath shewed his majesty toward a sinful nation. Convert therefore ye sinners, and do justice before God, believing that he will do his mercy with you. And I and my soul will rejoice in him. Bless ye our Lord all his elect, celebrate days of gladness, and confess to him. Jerusalem the city of God, our Lord hath chastised thee in the works of thy hands. Confess to our Lord in thy good things, and bless the God of the worlds, that he may re-edify his tabernacle in thee, and may call back all the captives to thee, and thou mayst rejoice for ever and ever. Thou shalt shine with a glorious light: and all the coasts of the earth shall adore thee. Nations from far shall come to thee: and bringing gifts, they shall adore our Lord in thee, and shall esteem thy land for sanctification. For they shall invocate the great name in thee. Cursed shall they be that shall contemn thee: and damned shall they be that shall blaspheme thee: and blessed shall they be that shall build thee. And thou shalt rejoice in thy children, because they shall all be blessed, and shall be gathered together to our Lord. Blessed are all that love thee, and that rejoice upon thy peace. My soul, bless thou our Lord, because he hath delivered Jerusalem his city from all her tribulations, the Lord our God. Blessed shall I be if there shall remain of my seed, to see the glory of Jerusalem The gates of Jerusalem shall be built of Sapphire and the Emerald: and all the compass of the walls thereof of precious stone. With white and clean stone shall all the streets thereof be paved: and in the streets thereof Alleluia shall be sung. Blessed be our Lord, which hath exalted it, and his Kingdom be for ever and ever over it. Amen.</div>
