			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. To thee have I lifted up mine eyes, which dwellest in the heavens. Behold as the eyes of servants, are on the hands of their masters, As the eyes of the handmaid on the hands of her mistress: so are our eyes to our Lord God until he have mercy on us. Have mercy on us, o Lord, have mercy on us: because we are much replenished with contempt. Because our soul is much replenished: reproach to them that abound, and contempt to the proud.</div>
