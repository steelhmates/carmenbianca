			<div class='roleText'>And the children of Israel added to do evil in the sight of our Lord after the death of Aod, and our Lord delivered them into the hands of Jabin the king of Chanaan, which reigned in Asor: and he had a captain of his army named Sisara, and he dwelt in Haroseth of the gentiles. And the children of Israel cried to our Lord, for he had nine hundred iron hooked chariots, and for twenty years had vehemently oppressed them. And there was one Debbora a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, which judged the people at that time. And she sat under a palm tree, which was called by her name, between Rama and Bethel in the mount of Ephraim: and the children of Israel went up to her for all judgment. Who sent, and called Barac the son of Abinoem of Cedes in Nephthali, and she said to him: Our Lord God of Israel hath commanded thee: Go, and lead an army into mount Thabor, and thou shalt take with thee ten thousand fighting men of the children of Nephthali, &amp; of the children of Zabulon: and I will bring unto thee in the place of the Torrent Cison, Sisara the Prince of the host of Jabin, and his chariots, and all the multitude, and will deliver them in thy hand. And Barac said to her: If thou come with me, I will go: If thou wilt not come with me, I will not go. Who said to him: I will go indeed with thee, but at this time the victory shall not be imputed to thee, because Sisara shall be delivered into the hand of a woman. Debbora therefore arose, and went with Barac into Cedes. Who calling unto him Zabulon and Nephthali, went up with ten thousand fighting men, having Debbora in his company. And Haber the Cineite was in time past departed from the rest of the Cineites his brethren of Hobab, the cousin of Moyses: and had pitched his tents unto the valley, which is called Sennim, and was near Cedes. And it was told Sisara, that Barac the son of Abinoem was gone up into mount Thabor: and he gathered nine hundred iron hooked chariots, and all his army from Haroseth of the gentiles to the torrent Cison. And Debbora said to Barac: Arise, for this is the day wherein our Lord hath delivered Sisara into thy hands: behold he is thy leader. And Barac went down from mount Thabor, and ten thousand fighting men with him. And our Lord terrified Sisara and all his chariots, &amp; all the multitude in the edge of the sword at the sight of Barac: in so much, that Sisara leaping down from his chariot, fled a-foot, &amp; Barac pursued the chariots flying, and the army unto Haroseth of the gentiles, and all the multitude of the enemies was utterly destroyed. But Sisara flying came to the tent of Jahel the wife of Haber the Cineite, for there was peace betwixt Jabin the king of Asor, and the house of Haber the Cineite. Jahel therefore going forth to meet Sisara, said to him: Come in to me, my lord, come in, fear not. Who being entered into her tabernacle, and covered of her with a cloak, said to her, Give me, I beseech thee, a little water, for I am very thirsty. Who opened a bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and covered him. And Sisara said to her: Stand before the door of the tabernacle, and when any shall come asking thee, and saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Is there any man here? Thou shalt say: There is none. Jahel therefore the wife of Haber took a nail of the tabernacle, taking withal a hammer also: and going in secretly, and with silence she put the nail upon the temple of his head, and striking it with the hammer, fastened it into his brain even to the ground: who joining deep sleep &amp; death together, fainted, and died. And behold Barac following Sisara came: and Jahel going forth to meet him, said to him: Come, and I will shew thee the man whom thou seekest. Who when he was entered in unto her, saw Sisara lying dead, and the nail fastened in his temples. Therefore God that day humbled Jabin the king of Chanaan before the children of Israel: which increased daily, and with strong hand oppressed Jabin the king of Chanaan, till they destroyed him.</div>
