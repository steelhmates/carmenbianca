			<div class='roleText'>To the children of Core, a Psalm of Canticle. The foundations thereof in the holy mountains: our Lord loveth the gates of Sion above all the Tabernacles of Jacob. Glorious things are said of thee, o city of God. I will be mindful of Rahab, and Babylon knowing me. Behold the foreigners, and Tyre, &amp; the people of the Aethiopians, these were there. Shall it not be said of Sion: Man and man, is born in her; and the Highest himself founded her? Our Lord will declare in scriptures of peoples, and of Princes: of those that have been in her. The habitation in thee, is as it were of all rejoicing.</div>
