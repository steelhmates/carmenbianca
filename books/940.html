			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the first of the month, the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man for that Tyre hath said of Jerusalem: Ah the gates of the peoples are broken, she is turned to me: I shall be filled, she is desert. Therefore thus saith our Lord God: Behold I upon thee o Tyre, and I will make many nations come up to thee, as the sea riseth up swelling. And they shall dissipate the walls of Tyre, and shall destroy the towers thereof: and I will scrape her dust from her, and will make her as a most clear rock. The drying of nets shall be in the midst of the sea, because I have spoken, saith our Lord God: and she shall be for a spoil to the Gentiles. Her daughters also that be in the field, shall be slain by the sword: and they shall know that I am the Lord. Because thus saith our Lord God: Behold I will bring to Tyre Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon from the North, the king of kings with horses, &amp; chariots, and horsemen, and multitude, &amp; a great people. Thy daughters that are in the field, he shall kill with the sword: &amp; he shall compass thee with munitions, and shall cast up a mount round about: and he shall lift up the buckler against thee. And he shall dispose ordinances, and engines against thy walls, and shall destroy thy towers with his armour. With the inundation of his horses, the dust of them shall cover thee: at the sound of the horsemen, and wheels, and chariots thy walls shall be moved, when he shall go in at thy gates, as by the entrance of a city destroyed. With the hoofs of his horses he shall tread down all thy streets: thy people he shall kill with the sword, and thy noble statues shall fall to the ground. They shall waste thy riches, they shall spoil thy merchandise: and they shall destroy thy walls, and shall overthrow thy goodly houses: and thy stones, and thy timber, and thy dust they shall put in the midst of the waters. And I will make the multitude of thy songs to cease, and the sound of thy harps shall be heard no more. And I will make thee as a most clear rock, drying of nets shall thou be, neither shalt thou be built any more: because I have spoken, saith our Lord God. Thus saith our Lord God to Tyre: Why, shall not the islands be moved at the sound of thy ruin, and the groaning of thy slain when they shall be killed in the midst of thee? And all the Princes of the sea shall go down from their seats: and take off their robes, and cast away their broidered garments, and be clothed with astonishment, sit on the earth, and being astonished marvel at thy sudden fall. And taking upon thee a lamentation, they shall say to thee: How hast thou perished that dwellest in the sea, o noble city, which hast been strong in the sea with thine inhabitants, whom all did fear? Now shall the ships be astonished in the day of thy fear: and the islands in the sea shall be troubled, for that none cometh forth out of thee. Because thus saith our Lord God: When I shall make thee a desolate city as the cities that are not inhabited: and shall bring upon thee the depth, &amp; many waters shall cover thee: and shall pluck thee down with those, that descend into the lake to the everlasting people, and shall place thee in the lowest ground as old desolations, with them that are brought down into the lake, that thou be not inhabited: moreover when I shall give glory in the land of the living, I will bring thee to nothing, &amp; thou shalt not be, and being sought for, thou shalt not be found any more for ever, saith our Lord God.</div>
