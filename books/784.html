			<div class='roleText'>Simon the son of Onias, the high priest, who in his life held up the house, and in his days strengthened the temple. The height also of the temple was founded by him, the double building and high walls of the temple. In his days the wells of waters flowed out, and they were filled as the sea above measure. Who had care of his nation, and delivered it from perdition. Who prevailed to amplify the city, who obtained glory in conversing with the nation: and amplified the entrance of the house, and the court. As the morning star in the midst of a cloud, and as the full moon he shineth in his days. And as the sun shining, so did he shine in the temple of God. As the rainbow that shineth among the clouds of glory, and as a flower of roses in the days of the spring, and as the lilies that are in the passage of water, and as frankincense smelling in summer days. As fire glistering, and frankincense burning in the fire. As a massy vessel of gold, adorned with every precious stone. As an olive tree budding, and a cypress tree advancing itself on high, when he took the robe of glory, and was revested to the consummation of strength. In going up to the holy altar, he made the vesture of holiness, glory. And in receiving the portions out of the hand of the Priests, himself also standing by the altar. About him was the ring of his brethren: and as the cedar plant in mount Libanus, so stood they about him as boughs of the palm tree, &amp; all the children of Aaron in their glory. And the oblation of our Lord in their hands, before all the synagogue of Israel: and executing the consummation on the altar, to amplify the oblation of the high King, he stretched forth his hand in oblation of moist sacrifice, and offered of the blood of the grape. He poured out on the foundation of the altar a divine odour to the high Prince. Then cried out the children of Aaron, they sounded with beaten trumpets, and made a great voice to be heard for a remembrance before God. Then all the people together made haste, and fell on their face upon the earth, to adore our Lord their God, and to make prayers to God Omnipotent the Highest. And the singers amplified in their voices, and in the great house the sound was increased full of sweetness. And the people in prayer desired our Lord the Highest, until the honour of our Lord was perfected, and they finished their office. Then coming down, he lifted up his hands over all the congregation of the children of Israel, to give glory to God from his lips, and to glory in his name, and he repeated his prayer, willing to shew the power of God. And now pray ye the God of all, who hath done great things in all the land, who hath increased our days from our mother's womb, and hath done with us according to his mercy: give he unto us joyfulness of heart everlasting: that Israel may believe that the mercy of God is with us, to deliver us in his days. Two nations my soul hateth: and the third is no nation, which I hate: they that sit in mount Seir, and the Philisthiims, and the foolish people that dwell in Sichem. Jesus the son of Sirach, a man of Jerusalem, wrote the doctrine of wisdom and discipline in this book, who renewed wisdom from his heart. Blessed is he, that converseth in these good things: and he that layeth them in his heart, shall be wise always. For if he do them, he shall be able to do all things: because his steps are in the light of God.</div>
