			<div class='roleText'>A gradual Canticle. But that our Lord was in us, let Israel now say, but that our Lord was in us. When men rose up against us, perhaps they had swallowed us alive: When their fury was angry against us, perhaps water had swallowed us. Our soul hath passed through a torrent: perhaps our soul had passed through an intolerable water. Blessed be our Lord which hath not given us for a prey to their teeth. Our soul as a sparrow is delivered from the snare of the fowlers: The snare is broken, and we are delivered. Our help is in the name of our Lord, who made heaven and earth.</div>
