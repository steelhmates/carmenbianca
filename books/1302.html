			<div class='roleText'>SIMON PETER^ servant and Apostle of JESUS Christ, to them that have obtained equal faith with us in the justice of our God and Saviour JESUS Christ. Grace to you &amp; peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God &amp; Christ JESUS our Lord: As all things of his divine power which pertain to life &amp; godliness, are given us by the knowledge of him which hath called us by his own proper glory and virtue, by whom he hath given us most great and precious promises: that by these you may be made partakers of the divine nature, flying the corruption of that concupiscence which is in the world. And you employing all care, minister ye in your faith, virtue: and in virtue, knowledge: and in knowledge, abstinence: and in abstinence, patience: and in patience, piety: and in piety, love of the fraternity: and in the love of the fraternity, charity. For if these things be present with you, and abound, they shall make you not vacant, nor without fruit in the knowledge of our Lord JESUS Christ. For, he that hath not these things ready, is blind, and groping with his hand, having forgotten the purging of his old sins. Wherefore, brethren, labour the more that by good works you may make sure your vocation and election. For, doing these things, you shall not sin at any time. For so there shall be ministered to you aboundantly an entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour JESUS Christ. For the which cause I will begin to admonish you always of these things: and you indeed knowing and being confirmed in the present truth. But I think it meet as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up by admonition: being certain that the laying away of my tabernacle is at hand, according as our Lord JESUS Christ also signified to me. And I will do my diligence, you to have often after my decease also, that you may keep a memory of these things. For, not having followed unlearned fables, have we made the power and presence of our Lord JESUS Christ known to you: but made beholders of his greatness. For, he receiving from God his Father honour and glory, this manner of voice coming down to him from the magnifical glory, This is my beloved Son in whom I have pleased myself, hear him. And this voice we heard brought from heaven, when we were with him in the holy mount. And we have the Prophetical word more sure: which you do well attending unto, as to a candle shining in a dark place, until the day dawn, &amp; the day-star arise in your hearts: understanding this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is made by private interpretation. For, not by man's will was prophecy brought at any time: but the holy men of God spake, inspired with the Holy Ghost.</div>
