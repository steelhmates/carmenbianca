And that we would not give our daughters to the people of the land, and their daughters we would not take to our sons. The peoples of the land, which bring in things to sell, &amp; all things to be used, to sell them on the Sabbath day, we will not take it of them in the Sabbath, &amp; in the sanctified day. And we will let pass the seventh year, &amp; the exaction of every hand. And we will ordain precepts upon ourselves, to give the third part of a sicle every year to the work of the house of our God. to the loaves of proposition, and to the continual sacrifice, &amp; for a continual holocaust in the Sabbaths, in the Calends, in the Solemnities, and in the sanctified, and for sin: that propitiation may be made for Israel, and unto all use of the house of our God. We therefore did cast lots concerning the oblation of wood between the Priests, and the Levites, and the people, that it should be brought into the house of our God by the houses of our fathers at set times, from year to year: that it might burn upon the altar of the Lord our God as it is written in the law of Moyses: And that we would bring the first born of our land, and the first fruits of all the fruit of every tree, from year to year, in the house of our Lord. and the first fruits of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is written in the law, and the first fruits of our oxen, and of our sheep, that they might be offered in the house of our God, to the Priests which minister in the house of our God. And the first fruits of our meats, and of our libaments, &amp; the fruits of every tree, of vintage also and of oil we will bring to the Priests, unto the treasury of our God, and the tenth part of our land to the Levites. The Levites themselves shall receive the tithes out of all the cities^ of our works. And the Priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites in the tithes of the Levites, and the Levites shall offer the tenth part of their tithe in the house of our God, to the treasury in the treasure-house. For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall carry to the treasury the first fruits of corn, of wine, and of oil: and the sanctified vessels shall be there, and the Priests, and singing men, and porters, and ministers, and we will not leave the house of our God.</div>
