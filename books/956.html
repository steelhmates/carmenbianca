			<div class='roleText'>And he brought me out into the utter court by the way that leadeth to the North, and he brought me into the cell, that was against the separated building, &amp; against the house bending to the North. In the face of the length, an hundred cubits of the North door: and the breadth fifty cubits, against the twenty cubits of the inner court, &amp; against the pavement paved with stone of the utter court, where was a porch joined to a triple porch. And before the cells a walk of ten cubits in breadth, looking to the inner parts of the way of one cubit. And their doors toward the North: Where were chambers in the upper parts more low: because they bare up the porches, which appeared above out of them from the nether parts, and from the midst of the building. For they were triple lofts, &amp; had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts: therefore did they appear above out of the nether places, and out of the middle places, from the ground fifty cubits. And an utter closure according to the cells, which were in the way of the utter court before the cells: the length thereof of fifty cubits. Because the length of the cells of the utter court was of fifty cubits: and the length before the face of the temple, of an hundred cubits. And there was under these cells an entrance from the East, going into them out of the utter court. In the breadth of the closure of the court, that was against the way of the East, toward the face of the separated building, and there were cells before the building. And the way before the face of them according to the similitude of the cells, which were in the way of the North: according to the length of them, so also was their breadth: and all the entrance of them, and similitudes, and their doors. According to the doors of the cells that were in the way looking to the South: a door in the head of the way, which way was before the entry separated by the way of the East going in. And he said to me: The cells of the North, and the cells of the South, which are before the separated building: these are the holy cells, wherein the Priests do eat, which approach to our Lord into Sancta Sanctorum, there shall they lay the holies of holies, and the oblation for sin, and for offence: for it is a holy place. And when the Priests shall be entered, they shall not go forth out of the holy places into the utter court: and there they shall lay their vestments, wherein they minister, because they are holy: and they shall be clothed with other vestments, &amp; so they shall go forth to the people. And when he had accomplished the measures of the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate, that looked to the way of the East: and he measured it on every side round about. And he measured against the East wind with the reed of measure, five hundred reeds in reed of measure round about. And he measured against the North wind five hundred reeds in reed of measure round about. And to the South wind he measured five hundred reeds, in reed of measure round about. And to the West wind he measured five hundred reeds, in reed of measure. By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side round about the length and breadth of five hundred reeds, dividing between the sanctuary and the place of the common people.</div>
