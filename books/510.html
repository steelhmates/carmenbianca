			<div class='roleText'>But our Lord answering Job out of a whirlwind, said: Who is this that wrappeth in sentences with unskillful words? Gird thy loins as a man: I will ask thee, and answer thou me. Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell me if thou hast understanding. Who set the measures thereof, if thou know: or who stretched out the line upon it? Upon what are the foundations thereof grounded? Or who let down the corner stone thereof, when the morning stars praised me together, and all the sons of God made jubilation? Who shut in the sea with doors when it brake forth, proceeding as it were out of a matrice: When I made a cloud the garment thereof, and wrapped it in darkness as in clouts of infancy. I compassed it with my bounds, and put bar and doors. And I said. Hitherto thou shalt come, and shalt not proceed farther, and here thou shalt break thy swelling waves. Didst thou after thy birth command the morning, and shew the dawning his place? And didst thou hold the extremities of the earth shaking them &amp; hast thou shaken the impious out of it? The seal shall be restored as clay, and shall stand as a garment: From the impious their light shall be taken away, and the high arm shall be broken. Hast thou entered into the depths of the sea, and walked in the lowest parts of the great depth? Have the gates of death been open to thee, &amp; hast thou seen the darksome doors? Hast thou considered the breadth of the earth? Tell me if thou know all things, In what way the light dwelleth, &amp; what is the place of darkness. That thou canst bring every thing to his borders, &amp; understand the paths of the house thereof. Didst thou know then that thou shouldest be born? &amp; didst thou know the number of thy days? Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow, or hast thou beheld treasures of hail? Which I have prepared for the time of the enemy, for the day of fight &amp; battle? What way is the light spread, is heat divided upon the earth? Who gave course to the most vehement shower, and the way of the sounding thunder: That it should rain upon the earth, without man in the desert, where no mortal man abideth: That it should fill the desert and desolate ground, and should bring forth green grass? Who is the father of rain? Or who begot the drops of dew? Out of whose womb came forth ice? And frost from heaven who engendered? Waters are hardened like stone, and the face of the depth is congealed. Shalt thou be able to join together the shining stars Pleiades, or canst thou dissipate the circuit of Arcturus? Doest thou bring forth the day star in his time, &amp; make the evening star to rise upon the children of the earth? Doest thou know the order of heaven, and shalt thou put down the reason thereof on the earth? Shalt thou elevate the voice in the cloud, &amp; the violence of the waters cover thee? Shalt thou send lightnings, and will they go, and returning shall they say to thee: Here we are? Who put wisdom in the heart of man or who gave the cock understanding? Who shall declare the manner of the heavens, and the harmony of heaven who shall make to sleep? When was the dust poured on the earth, and the clods compact together? Shalt thou take a prey for the lioness and fill the appetite of her whelps? When they lie in the dens, &amp; in holes sit in wait? Who prepareth for the raven her meat, when her young ones cry to God, wandering about, because they have not meat?</div>
