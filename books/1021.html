			<div class='roleText'>THE word of our Lord that was made to Sophonie the son of Chusi, the son of Godolias, the son of Amarias, the son of Ezechias, in the days of Josias the son of Amon king of Juda. Gathering I will gather together all things from the face of the earth, saith our Lord: gathering man, and beast, gathering the fowls of the heaven, and fishes of the sea: and there shall be ruins of the impious: and I will destroy men from the face of the earth, saith our Lord. And I will stretch forth my hand upon Juda, and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and I will destroy out of this place the remnant of Baal, and the names of the temple-wardens with the priests: and them that adore upon the tops of houses the host of heaven, and adore, and swear by our Lord, and swear by Melchom. And them that turn away from after the back of our Lord, and that have not sought our Lord, nor searched after him. Be silent before the face of our Lord God: because the day of our Lord is near, because our Lord hath prepared an host, he hath sanctified his called. And it shall be: in the day of the host of our Lord I will visit upon the princes, and upon the king's sons, and upon all that are clothed with strange clothing: and I will visit upon every one, that arrogantly entereth upon the threshold in that day, them that fill the house of our Lord their God with iniquity, &amp; guile. And it shall be in that day, saith our Lord, the voice of clamor from the gate of fishes, and howling from the second, and great destruction from the hills. Howl ye inhabitants of the Morter. All the people of Chanaan is hush, all are perished that were wrapped in silver. &amp; it shall be in that time: I will search Jerusalem with lamps, and will visit upon the men that are fixed in their dregs: that say in their hearts: The Lord will not do good, and he will not do evil. And their strength shall be into spoil, and their houses as a desert: and they shall build houses, and shall not inhabit them: and shall plant vineyards, &amp; shall not drink the wine of them. The great day of our Lord is near, it is near and exceeding swift: the voice of the day of our Lord is bitter, the strong shall there have tribulation. That day a day of wrath, a day of tribulation and distress, a day of calamity and misery, a day of darkness and mist, a day of cloud &amp; whirlwind: a day of the trumpet and sound upon the fenced cities, &amp; upon the high corners. And I will afflict men, and they shall walk as blindmen, because they have sinned to our Lord: and their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their bodies as dung. Yea and their silver, and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of our Lord: in the fire of his jealousy shall all the earth be devoured, because he will make consummation with speed to all that inhabit the earth.</div>
