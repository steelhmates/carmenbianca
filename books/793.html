			<div class='roleText'>And our Lord said to me: Take thee a great book, &amp; write in it with the pen of man. Take away the spoils speedily, quickly take preys. And I took to me faithful witnesses, Urias the Priest, &amp; Zacharias the son of Barachias. And I went to the Prophetess, and she conceived, and bare a son. And our Lord said to me: Call his name, Hasten to take away the spoils: make haste to take preys. For before the child know to call his father and his mother, the strength of Damascus shall be taken away, and the spoils of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians. And our Lord added yet to speak unto me, saying: For that this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe, that run with silence, and rather taken Rasin, and the son of Romelia: for this cause behold our Lord will bring upon them the waters of the river strong and many, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and he will ascend over all their rivers, and will flow over all their banks. And will go through Juda, overflowing, and passing through shall come even to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land o Emmanuel. Gather ye together o peoples, and be overcome, and hear all ye lands far off: Take courage, and be overcome, gird yourselves, &amp; be overcome. Take counsel and it shall be defeated: speak a word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us. For thus saith our Lord to me: As in a strong arm he hath taught me, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying: Say not, Conspiracy: for all things that this people speaketh, is conspiracy: and fear ye not their fear, neither dread ye. The Lord of hosts him sanctify ye: be he your dread, and he your terror. And he shall be a sanctification to you. But for a stone of offence, and for a rock of scandal to the two houses of Israel, for a snare &amp; a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And very many of them shall stumble and fall, and shall be broken in pieces, and shall be snared, and taken. Bind the testimony, seal the law in my disciples. And I will expect our Lord, who hath hid his face from the house of Jacob, and I will wait for him. Behold I and my children, whom our Lord hath given me for a sign, and for a wonder in Israel from the Lord of hosts, which dwelleth in mount Sion. And when they shall say to you: Ask of Pythons, and of diviners, which whisper in their enchantments: shall not the people ask vision of their God, for the living of the dead? To the law rather, and to the testimony. As if they speak not according to this word, they shall not have the morning light. And he shall pass by it, shall fall, and be hungry: and when he shall be hungry, he will be angry, and curse his king, and his God, and will look upwards. And he will look to the earth, and behold tribulation and darkness, dissolution and distress, and mist persecuting, and he cannot fly away from his distress.</div>
