			<div class='roleText'>The word, that was made to Jeremy, to all the Jews, that dwelt in the Land of Aegypt, dwelling in Magdal, and in Taphnis, and in Memphis, and in the Land of Phatures, saying: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: You have seen all this evil, that I have brought upon Jerusalem, &amp; upon all the cities of Juda: and behold they are desolate this day, and there is not an inhabiter in them: for the malice, which they have done, to provoke me to wrath, &amp; to go and sacrifice, &amp; worship false gods, which both they, &amp; you, &amp; your fathers knew not. And I have sent to you all my servants the Prophets, in the night rising, and sending and saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Do not the word of this manner of abomination, which I hated. And they heard not, nor inclined their ear to return from their evils, &amp; not to sacrifice to strange gods. And mine indignation, and my fury is poured out, &amp; it is kindled in the cities of Juda, &amp; in the streets of Jerusalem: &amp; they are turned into desolation &amp; waste according to this day. And now thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Why do you this great evil against your own souls, that there should die of you man and woman, child and suckling out of the midst of Juda, and nothing be left remaining unto you: provoking me in the works of your hands, in sacrificing to strange gods in the Land of Aegypt, into which you are entered to inhabit there: and that you should perish, and be a malediction, and a reproach to all the nations of the earth? Why, have you forgotten the evils of your fathers, and the evils of the kings of Juda, and the evils of their wives, and your evils, and the evils of your wives, that they have done in the Land of Juda, and in the countries of Jerusalem? They are not cleansed even to this day: and they have not feared, and they have not walked in the law of the Lord, and in my precepts, which I have given before you and your fathers. Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: Behold I will set my face upon you to evil: and I will destroy all Juda. And I will take the remnant of Juda, which have set their face to go into the Land of Aegypt, and to dwell there, and they shall be all consumed in the Land of Aegypt: they shall fall by the sword, and by famine: &amp; they shall be consumed from the least even to the greatest, by the sword, and by famine shall they die: and they shall be for an oath, and for a miracle, and into malediction, and into reproach. And I will visit the inhabitants of the Land of Aegypt, as I have visited upon Jerusalem in sword, and famine, and pestilence. And there shall be none that shall escape, and be remaining of the remnant of the Jews, that go to sojourn in the Land of Aegypt: &amp; that shall return into the Land of Juda, to the which they elevate their souls, for to return and dwell there: there shall none return but they that shall fly. But all the men that knew that their wives sacrificed to strange gods: and all the women of whom there stood a great multitude, and all the people of the inhabitants in the Land of Aegypt in Phatures, answered Jeremy, saying: The word, which thou hast spoken to us in the name of our Lord, we will not hear of thee: But doing we will do every word, that shall proceed out of our own mouth, to sacrifice unto the queen of heaven, and to offer libaments unto her, as we and our fathers have done, our kings, and our Princes in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, and we were filled with bread, and it was well with us, and we saw no evil. But from that time, since we ceased to sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and to offer libaments unto her, we lack all things, &amp; we are consumed with sword, &amp; famine. And if we sacrifice to the queen of heaven, and offer libaments to her: why, have we without our husbands made her cakes to worship her, and to offer libaments to her? And Jeremy said to all the people against the men, and against the women, and against all the people, that had answered him the word saying: Why, the sacrifice that you have sacrificed in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, you and your fathers, your kings, and your Princes, and the people of the land, is not our Lord mindful of them, and hath it not ascended upon his heart? And our Lord would bear no longer for the malice of your studies, and for the abominations, which you have done, and your land is brought into desolation, and into astonishment, and into malediction, for that there is not an inhabiter, as is this day. Because you have sacrificed to idols, and have sinned to our Lord: and have not heard the voice of our Lord, and have not walked in his law, and in his precepts, and in his testimonies: therefore are these evils fallen to you, as is this day. And Jeremy said to all the people, and to all the women: Hear you the word of our Lord all Juda, which are in the Land of Aegypt: Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord God liveth^ in all the Land of Aegypt. Behold I will watch upon them to evil, and not to good: and all the men of Juda that are in the Land of Aegypt, shall be consumed, with sword, and famine, till they be utterly consumed. And they that shall escape the sword, shall return out of the Land of Aegypt into the Land of Juda a few men: and all the remnant of Juda that go into the Land of Aegypt, to dwell there, shall know, whose word is accomplished, mine, or theirs. And this shall be a sign for you, saith our Lord, that I visit upon you in this place: that you may know that my words shall be accomplished indeed against you to evil. Thus saith our Lord: Behold I will deliver Pharao Ephree the king of Aegypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand of them that seek his life: as I have delivered Sedecias the king of Juda into the hand of Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon his enemy, and that seeketh his life.</div>
