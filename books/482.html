			<div class='roleText'>My soul is weary of my life, I will let my speech pass against myself. I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. I will say to God: Condemn me not: tell me why thou judgest me so. Doth it seem good to thee, if thou calumniate me, and oppress me^ the work of thy hands, and help the counsel of the impious? Hast thou eyes of flesh: or as a man seeth, shalt thou also see? Are thy days as the days of man, and are thy years as the times of men: That thou seekest my iniquity, and searchest my sin? And thou mayst know that I have done no impious thing, whereas there is no man that can deliver out of thy hand. Thy hands have made me, &amp; framed me wholly round-about, &amp; dost thou so suddenly cast me down headlong? Remember I beseech thee that as clay thou madest me, &amp; into dust thou wilt bring me again. Hast thou not as milk milked me, and curded me as cheese? With skin &amp; flesh thou hast clothed me: with bones and sinews thou hast compacted me. Life and mercy thou hast given to me, and thy visitation hath kept my spirit. Although thou conceal these things in thy heart, yet I know that thou rememberest all things. If I have sinned and thou hast spared me for an hour: why doest thou not suffer me to be clean from mine iniquity? And if I shall be impious, woe is to me: and if just, I shall not lift up my head, filled with affliction and misery. And for pride as a lioness thou wilt take me, and returning thou doest marvelously torment me. Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, &amp; multipliest thy wrath toward me, and pains do war upon me. Why didst thou bring me forth out of the matrice? Who would God, I had been consumed, that eye might not see me. I had been as if I were not, carried from the womb to the grave. Shall not the fewness of my days be ended shortly? suffer me therefore, that I may a little lament my sorrow: Before I go, and return not, unto the dark land, that is covered with the mist of death: A land of misery and darkness, where is the shadow of death, and no order, but everlasting horror inhabiteth.</div>
