			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, to the sons of Core, for the secrets. Our God is a refuge and strength: an helper in tribulations, which have found us exceedingly. Therefore will we not fear when the earth shall be troubled: and mountains transported into the heart of the sea. Their waters have sounded, and were troubled: the mountains were troubled in his strength. The violence of the river maketh the city of God joyful: the Highest hath sanctified his tabernacle. God is in the midst thereof, it shall not be moved: God will help it in the morning early. Nations are troubled, and Kingdoms are inclined: he gave his voice, the earth was moved. The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our defender. Come ye, &amp; see the works of our Lord, what wonders he hath put upon the earth: taking away wars even unto the end of the earth. He shall destroy bow, &amp; break weapons: and shields he shall burn with fire. Be quiet, and see that I am God: I shall be exalted among the gentiles, and I shall be exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts is with us: the God of Jacob is our defender.</div>
