			<div class='roleText'>Five and twenty years old was Joathan when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: the name of his mother was Jerusa the daughter of Sadoc. And he did that which was right before our Lord, according to all things, which Ozias his father had done, saving that he entered not in the temple of our Lord, and as yet the people did sin. He built the high gate of the house of our Lord, and in the wall of Ophel he built many things. Cities also he built in the mountains of Juda, and castles, and towers in the forests. He fought against the king of the children of Ammon, and overcame them, and the children of Ammon gave him at that time an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand cores of wheat, and as many cores of barley: the children of Ammon gave him these things in the second and third year. And Joathan was strengthened, because he had directed his ways before our Lord his God. But the rest of the words of Joathan, and all his battles, and works, are written in the Book of the kings of Israel and Juda. He was five &amp; twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. And Joathan slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the City of David: And Achaz his son reigned for him.</div>
