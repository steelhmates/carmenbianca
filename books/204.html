These are the children of Manasses the son of Joseph, males by their kindreds. But Salphaad the son of Hepher the son of Galaad the son of Machir the son of Manasses had no sons, but only daughters: whose names be these, Maala &amp; Noa and Hegla and Melcha and Thersa. And they came in the presence of Eleazar the Priest, and of Josue the son of Nun, and of the Princes, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Our Lord commanded by the hand of Moyses, that a possession should be given us in the midst of our brethren. And he gave them according to the commandment of our Lord a possession in the midst of their father's brethren. And the cords fell to Manasses, ten, beside the Land of Galaad and Basan beyond Jordan. For the daughters of Manasses possessed inheritance in the midst of his sons. And the Land of Galaad fell to the lot of the children of Manasses that remained. And the border of Manasses from Aser, was Machmethath which looketh to Sichem: and goeth out on the right hand beside the inhabitants of the Fountain of Taphua. For in the lot of Manasses was fallen the Land of Taphua, which is beside the borders of Manasses, the childrens of Ephraim. And the border of the Reed valley went down into the south of the torrent of the cities of Ephraim, which are in the midst of the cities of Manasses: the border of Manasses on the North of the torrent, and the issue thereof goeth to the sea: so that the possession of Ephraim is on the south, and on the North of Manasses, and the sea encloseth both, and they be joined one to another in the tribe of Aser on the North, and in the tribe of Issachar on the East. And the inheritance of Manasses in Issachar and in Aser was Bethsan and the villages thereof, and Jeblaam with the villages thereof, and the inhabitants of Dor with the towns thereof, the inhabitants also of Endor with the towns thereof, and in like manner the inhabitants of Thenac with the towns thereof, and the inhabitants of Mageddo with the towns thereof, and the third part of the city of Nopheth. Neither could the children of Manasses overthrow the cities, but the Chananite began to dwell in his Land. But after that the children of Israel grew to be strong, they subdued the Chananites, and made them their tributaries, neither did they kill them. And the children of Joseph spake to Josue, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>If thou be a great people, go up into the wood, and cut thee room in the Land of the Pherezite and Raphaims: because the possession of mount Ephraim is narrow for thee. To whom the children of Joseph answered: We cannot go up to the mountains, whereas the Chananites that dwell in the champion country, wherein are situated Bethsan with the towns thereof and Jezrael possessing the midst of the valley, use iron chariots. And Josue said to the house of Joseph, of Ephraim, and Manasses: Thou art a great people, and of great strength, thou shalt not have one lot, but thou shalt pass to the mountain, and shalt cut and make glades for thee to inhabit: and mayest proceed farther, when thou hast subverted the Chananite, whom thou sayest to have iron chariots, and to be very strong.</div>
