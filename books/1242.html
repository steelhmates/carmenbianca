			<div class='roleText'>BRETHREN, and if a man be preoccupated in any fault, you that are spiritual, instruct such an one in the spirit of lenity, considering thine own self, lest thou also be tempted. Bear ye one another's burdens: and so you shall fulfill the law of Christ. For if any man esteem himself to be something, whereas he is nothing, he seduceth himself. But let every one prove his own work, and so in himself only shall he have the glory and not in another. For every one shall bear his own burden. And let him that is catechized in the word, communicate to him that catechizeth him, in all his goods. Be not deceived, God is not mocked. For what things a man shall sow, those also shall he reap. For he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap corruption. But he that soweth in the spirit, of the spirit shall reap life everlasting. And doing good, let us not fail. For in due time we shall reap not failing. Therefore whiles we have time, let us work good to all, but especially to the domesticals of the faith. See with what manner of letters I have written to you with mine own hand. Whosoever will please in the flesh, they force you to be circumcised, only that they may not suffer the persecution of the cross of Christ. For neither they that are circumcised, do keep the Law: but they will have you to be circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh. But God forbid that I should glory, saving in the cross of our Lord JESUS Christ; by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world. For in Christ JESUS neither circumcision availeth ought, nor prepuce, but a new creature. And whosoever shall follow this rule, peace upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God. From henceforth let no man be troublesome to me. For I bear the marks of our Lord JESUS in my body. The grace of our Lord JESUS Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</div>
