			<div class='roleText'>FROM hence-forth, my brethren, rejoice in our Lord. To write the same things unto you, to me surely it is not tedious, and to you it is necessary. See the dogs, see the evil workers, see the concision. For we are the circumcision, which in spirit serve God: and we glory in Christ JESUS, and not having confidence in the flesh, albeit I also have confidence in the flesh. If any other man seem to have confidence in the flesh, I more, circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, an Hebrew of Hebrews: according to the Law, a Pharisee: according to emulation, persecuting the Church of God: according to the justice that is in the Law, conversing without blame. But the things that were gains to me, those have I esteemed for Christ, detriments. Yea but I esteem all things to be detriment for the passing knowledge of JESUS Christ my Lord: for whom I have made all things as detriment, and do esteem them as dung, that I may gain Christ: and may be found in him not having my justice which is of the Law, but that which is of the faith of Christ, which is of God, justice in faith: to know him, and the virtue of his resurrection, and the society of his passions, configured to his death, if by any means I may come to the resurrection which is from the dead. Not that now I have received, or now am perfect: but I pursue, if I may comprehend, wherein I am also comprehended of Christ JESUS. Brethren, I do not account that I have comprehended. Yet one thing: forgetting the things that are behind, but stretching forth myself to those that are before, I pursue to the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation of God in Christ JESUS. Let us therefore as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if you be any otherwise minded, this also God hath revealed to you. Nevertheless whereunto we are come, that we be of the same mind, let us continue in the same rule. Be followers of me, brethren, &amp; observe them that walk so as you have our form. For many walk whom often I told you of (and now weeping also I tell you) the enemies of the cross of Christ: Whose end is destruction: whose God, is the belly: and their glory in their confusion, which mind worldly things. But our conversation is in Heaven: whence also we expect the Saviour, our Lord JESUS Christ, who will reform the body of our humility, configured to the body of his glory, according to the operation whereby also he is able to subdue all things to himself.</div>
