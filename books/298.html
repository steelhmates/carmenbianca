			<div class='roleText'>And his own house Salomon built in thirteen years, and brought it to perfection. He built also the house of the forest of Libanus of an hundred cubits in length, &amp; fifty cubits in breadth, and thirty cubits in height: and four galleries between pillars of cedar: for he had cut cedar trees into pillars. And he decked the whole vault with boards of cedar, which was held up with five &amp; forty pillars, And one order had fifteen pillars, set one against another, and looked one over against another, with equal space between the pillars, &amp; over the pillars square beams in all equal. And the porch of the pillars he made of fifty cubits in length, and thirty cubits in breadth: and another porch before the greater porch: and pillars, and tops upon the pillars. He made also the porch of the throne, wherein the seat of judgment is; and covered it with cedar wood from the pavement unto the top. And the little house, where they sat in judgment, was in the midst of the porch of like work. He made also a house for the daughter of Pharao (which Salomon had taken to wife) of such work, as also this porch. All of chosen stones, which were sawed by a certain rule and measure both within and without: from the foundation to the top of the walls, and without unto the greater court. And the foundations of chosen stones, great stones of ten or eight cubits. And above there were hewed chosen stones of equal measure, and in like manner of cedar. And the greater court round with three rews of hewed stones, and one rew of planed cedar, moreover also in the inner court of the house of our Lord, and in the porch of the house. King Salomon also sent, and took Hiram from Tyre, the son of a widow woman of the tribe of Nephthali, his father, a Tyrian, an artificer in brass, and full of wisdom, and intelligence, and skill to make all work of brass. Who when he was come to king Salomon, made all his work. And he cast two brazen pillars, of eighteen cubits in height one pillar: and a line of twelve cubits compassed both pillars. He made also two little heads, which should be put upon the heads of the pillars, cast of brass: five cubits high one little head, and five cubits the other little head: and as it were in manner of a net, &amp; of chains knit one to the other with marvelous work. Both little heads of the pillars were cast: seven rews of little nets in one little head, &amp; seven little nets in the other little head. And finished the pillars, and two rews round about every net, that they might cover the little heads, which were over the top of the pomegranates: in like manner did he also to the second little head. And the little heads, that were upon the heads of the pillars, were made as it were with lily work, in the porch, of four cubits. And again other little heads in the top of the pillars above, according to the measure of the pillar against the little nets: and of the pomegranates were two hundred rews round about the second little head. And he set two pillars in the porch of the temple: &amp; when he had erected the pillar on the right hand, he called the name thereof Iachin: in like manner he erected the second pillar, &amp; called the name thereof Booz. And upon the heads of the pillars he put a work in manner of a lily: and the work of the pillars was perfected. He made also a sea of founder's work, of ten cubits from brim to brim, round in compass, the height thereof was of five cubits, and a cord of thirty cubits did compass it round about. And the graving under the brim compassed it, ten cubits going about the lavatory: there were two rews of chamfered furrowed gravings cast. And it stood upon twelve oxen, of which three looked to the North, and three to the West, and three to the South, and three to the East, and the sea was over them: whose hinder parts were all hid inward. And the thickness of the lavatory was of three ounces: and the brim thereof as it were the brim of a chalice, and the leaf of crisped lily: it contained two thousand bates. And he made ten brazen feet, of four cubits in length every foot, and four cubits in breadth, and three cubits in height. And the very work itself of the feet, was entergraven: and entergravings between the jointures. And between the little crowns and the plaits, lions, and oxen, and Cherubs: and in the jointures likewise above: and under the lions &amp; oxen as it were bands of brass hanging down. And four wheels at every foot, and axletrees of brass: and at four sides as it were little shoulders under the lavatory cast, looking one against another. The mouth also of the lavatory was inward in the top of the head: and that which appeared outward, was of one cubit all round, and together it had one cubit and a half: and in the corners of the pillars were diverse engravings: and the middle enterpillars square not round. The four wheels also which were at the four corners of a foot, joined one to another under the foot: one wheel had in height a cubit and a half. And they were such wheels as are accustomed to be made in a chariot: and their axletrees and spokes, and strakes, and naves, all cast. For those four little shoulders also at every corner of one foot, were cast out of the foot and joined together. And in the top of the foot was a certain roundness of half a cubit, so wrought, that the lavatory might be put thereon, having the engravings thereof, and diverse carvings of it-self. He graved also in those ceilings, which were of brass, and in the corners, cherubs, and lions, and palmtrees, as it were in the similitude of a man standing, that they seemed not to be engraven, but put to round about. After this manner made he ten feet, of one casting and measure, and like graving. He made also ten lavatories of brass: one lavatory contained forty bates, and it was of four cubits: also at every foot, that is ten, he put so many lavatories. And he set the ten feet, five on the right side of the temple, and five on the left: and the sea he put on the right side of the temple against the East toward the South. Hiram therefore made cauldrons, and shovels, &amp; little pots, and perfected all the work of king Salomon in the temple of our Lord. Two pillars, and two cords of the little heads upon the little heads of the pillars: and two little nets, to cover the two cords, that were over the heads of the pillars. And four hundred pomegranates in the two nets: two rews of pomegranates in every net, to cover the cords of the little heads, which were upon the heads of the pillars. And ten feet, and ten lavatories upon the feet. And one sea, and twelve oxen under the sea. And cauldrons, &amp; shovels, and little pots. All the vessels that Hiram made to king Salomon in the house of our Lord, were of bright latten. In the champion country of Jordan did the king cast those things in a clay ground, between Socoth &amp; Sarthan. And Salomon placed all the vessels: but for the exceeding great multitude the brass could not be weighed. And Salomon made all the vessels in the house of our Lord: an altar of gold, and a table, whereupon the loaves of proposition should be put, of gold: and candlesticks of gold, five on the right hand, and five on the left against the oracle, of pure gold: and as it were little flowers, and lamps above of gold: and golden snuffers, and water pots, and fleshhooks, and phials, and mortars, and censers, of most pure gold: and the hinges of doors of the inner Sanctum Sanctorum, and of the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold. And Salomon perfected all the work that he did in the house of our Lord, and brought in the things that David his father had sanctified, silver and gold, and the vessels, and laid them in the treasures of the house of our Lord.</div>
