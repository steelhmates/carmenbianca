Thou therefore o son of man fear them not, neither be afraid of their words: because the incredulous and subverters are with thee, &amp; thou dwellest with scorpions. Fear not their words, and of their looks be not afraid: because it is an exasperating house. Thou therefore shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear, and be quiet, because they are provokers to anger. But thou son of man hear whatsoever I speak to thee: and be not exasperating, as it is an exasperating house: open thy mouth, and eat whatsoever I give thee. And I looked, and behold, an hand sent to me, wherein was a rolled book: and he spread it before me, which was written within and without: and there were written in it lamentations, and a song, and woe.</div>
