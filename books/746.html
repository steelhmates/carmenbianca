			<div class='roleText'>If thou wilt do good, know to whom thou doest it, and there shall be much thank in thy good deeds. Do good to the just, and thou shalt find great reward: and if not of him, assuredly of our Lord. For it is not well with him, that is ever occupied in evil things, and that giveth not alms: because the Highest both hateth sinners, and hath mercy on them that are penitent. Give to the merciful, and receive not the sinner: both to the impious &amp; to sinners he will repay vengeance, keeping them unto the day of vengeance. Give to the good, and receive not a sinner. Do good to the humble, and give not to the impious: prohibit to give him bread, lest therein he be mightier than thou: for thou shalt find double evils in all the good, whatsoever thou shalt do to him: because the Highest hateth sinners, and will repay vengeance to the impious. A friend shall not be known in prosperity, and an enemy shall not be hid in adversity. In the prosperity of a man, his enemies are in sorrow, and in affliction a friend is known. Credit not thine enemy for ever: for as a brass pot his wickedness rusteth: and if humbling himself he go crouching, be advised in thy mind, and beware of him. Place him not by thee, neither let him sit on thy right hand, lest perhaps turning into thy place, he seek after thy seat: and at the last thou know my words, and be pricked in my sayings. Who will have pity upon the enchanter striking of a serpent, or of any that come near to beasts? So also he that keepeth company with a wicked man, and is wrapped in his sins. For one hour he will tarry with thee: but if thou decline, he will not abide it. In his lips the enemy speaketh sweetly, and in his heart he lieth in wait, that he may overthrow thee into the pit. In his eyes the enemy weepeth: and if he may find a time, he will not be satisfied with blood: and if evils happen to thee, thou shalt find him there first. In his eyes the enemy weepeth, and as it were helping thee, he will undermine thy feet. He will shake his head, and clap his hand, and whispering many things he will change his countenance.</div>
