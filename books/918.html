			<div class='roleText'>And thou son of man take thee a brick, and thou shalt put it before thee: and thou shalt draw in it the city of Jerusalem. And thou shalt lay siege against it, and shall build munitions, and cast up a bank, and pitch camps against it, and place engines round about. And thou take thee an iron frying pan, and thou shalt set it as an iron wall between thee and the city: &amp; thou shalt set thy face steadily toward it, &amp; it shall be besieged, &amp; thou shalt compass it: which is a sign to the house of Israel. And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt put the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days, that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take their iniquity. And I have given thee, the years of their iniquity, according to the number of days three hundred and ninety days: and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. And when thou hast accomplished these things, thou shalt sleep upon thy right side the second time: and thou shalt take the iniquity of the house of Juda forty days, a day for a year, a day, I say, for a year I have given thee. And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of Jerusalem, &amp; thine arm shall be stretched out: and thou shalt prophesy against it. Behold I have compassed thee with bands: &amp; thou shalt not turn thyself from thy side unto the other side, till thou accomplish the days of the siege. And thou take thee wheat and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches: and thou shalt put them into one vessel, and make thee loaves according to the number of the days, that thou shalt sleep upon thy side: three hundred &amp; ninety days shalt thou eat it. And thy meat, that thou shalt eat, shall be in weight twenty staters a day: from time to time thou shalt eat it. And water by measure thou shalt drink, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time thou shalt drink it. And as hearth baken barley bread thou shalt eat it: and with the dung that cometh out of a man, thou shalt cover it before their eyes. And our Lord said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>A, a, a, o Lord God, behold my soul is not polluted, and a dead thing, and thing torn of beasts, I have not eaten from mine infancy even till this time, and all unclean flesh hath not entered into my mouth. And he said to me: Behold I have given thee dung of oxen for man's dung, and thou shalt make thy bread therewith. And he said to me: Son of man, Behold I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread in weight, and in carefulness: and they shall drink water in measure, and in distress. That bread and water failing, every man may fall against his brother, and they may pine away in their iniquities.</div>
