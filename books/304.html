			<div class='roleText'>And behold a man of God came out of Juda, in the word of our Lord into Bethel, Jeroboam standing upon the altar, and censing. And he cried out against the altar in the word of our Lord, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Altar, altar, thus saith our Lord: Behold a child shall be born to the house of David, named Josias, and he shall immolate upon thee priests of the excelses, which now do burn frankincense on thee, and he shall burn men's bones upon thee. And he gave a sign in that day, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>This shall be the sign, that our Lord hath spoken: Behold the altar shall be cloven, and the ashes on it shall be poured out. And when the king had heard the word of the man of God, which he cried out against the altar in Bethel, he stretched forth his hand from the altar, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Take him. And his hand withered, which he stretched forth against him: neither was he able to draw it back upon him. The altar also was cloven, and the ashes were poured out of the altar, according to the sign which the man of God had told before in the word of our Lord. And the king said to the man of God: Beseech the face of our Lord thy God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored me. And the man of God besought the face of our Lord, and the king's hand was restored to him, and it became as it was before. And the king spake to the man of God: Come home with me, that thou mayst dine, and I will give thee gifts. And the man of God answered the king: If thou wouldest give me the half part of thy house, I will not come with thee, nor eat bread, nor drink water in this place: for so was it enjoined in the word of our Lord commanding: Thou shalt not eat bread, nor drink water, nor return by the way that thou camest. He departed therefore by another way, and returned not by the way, that he came into Bethel. And a certain Prophet being old dwelt in Bethel, to whom his sons came and told him all the works, that the man of God had done that day in Bethel: and the words which he had spoken to the king, they told their father. And their father said to them: What way went he? His sons shewed him the way, by which the man of God was gone, which came out of Juda. And he said to his sons: Saddle me an ass. Who when they had saddled it, he got up, and went after the man of God, and found him sitting under a terebinth: and he said to him: Art thou the man of God that camest out of Juda? He answered: I am he. And he said to him: Come home with me, that thou mayst eat bread. Who said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Bring him back with thee into thy house, that he may eat bread, and drink water. He deceived him, and brought him back with him: he did eat therefore bread in his house, and drunk water. And when they sat at the table, the word of our Lord came to the Prophet, that brought him back. And he cried out to the man of God, which came out of Juda, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Thus saith our Lord: Because thou hast not been obedient to the mouth of our Lord, and hast not kept the commandment which our Lord thy God commanded thee, and hast returned, and eaten bread, and drunk water in the place wherein he commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat bread, nor drink water, thy dead body shall not be brought into the sepulchre of thy fathers. And when he had eaten and drunk, he saddled his ass for the Prophet, whom he brought back. Who when he was gone, a lion found him in the way, and killed him, and his body was cast forth in the way: and the ass stood by him, and the lion stood by the dead body. And behold, men passing by saw the dead body cast in the way, and the lion standing beside the body. And they came and divulged it in the city, wherein that old Prophet dwelt. Which when that Prophet heard, which had brought him back out of the way, he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>It is the man of God, that was disobedient to the mouth of our Lord, and our Lord hath delivered him to the lion, &amp; he hath torn him, and killed him according to the word of our Lord, that he spake to him. And he said to his sons: Saddle me an ass. Who when they had saddled, and he was gone, he found his dead body cast forth in the way, and the ass and the lion standing by the corpse: the lion did not eat of the dead body, nor hurt the ass. The Prophet therefore took the corpse of the man of God, and laid it upon the ass, and returning brought it into the city of the old Prophet, that they might mourn for him. And he laid his corpse in his own sepulchre: and they mourned for him: Alas, alas my brother. And when they had mourned for him, he said to his sons: When I shall be dead, bury me in the sepulchre, wherein the man of God is buried: beside his bones lay my bones. For assuredly the word shall come to pass, which he hath foretold in the word of our Lord against the altar that is in Bethel: and against all the temples of the excelses, that are in the cities of Samaria. After these words Jeroboam returned not from his wicked way, but on the contrary part he made of the most abject of the people Priests of the excelses: Whosoever would, he filled his hand, and he was made a Priest of the excelses. And for this cause did the house of Jeroboam sin, and was overthrown, and destroyed from the face of the earth.</div>
