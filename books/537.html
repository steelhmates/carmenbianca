			<div class='roleText'>The first of the Sabbath, the Psalm of David. The earth is our Lord's, and the fullness thereof: the round world, and all that dwell therein. Because he hath founded it upon the seas: and upon the rivers hath prepared it. Who shall ascend into the mount of our Lord? Or who shall stand in his holy place? The innocent of hands, and of clean heart, that hath not taken his soul in vain, nor sworn to his neighbour in guile. He shall receive blessing of our Lord: and mercy of God his Saviour. This is the generation of them that seek him, of them that seek the face of the God of Jacob. Lift up your gates ye Princes, and be ye lifted up, o eternal gates: and the King of glory shall enter in. Who is this King of glory? Our Lord strong &amp; mighty, our Lord mighty in battle. Lift up your gates ye Princes, and be ye lifted up, o eternal gates: and the King of glory shall enter in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord of powers^ he is the King of glory.</div>
