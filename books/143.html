			<div class='roleText'>To these shall the land be divided according to the number of names for their possessions. To the greater number thou shalt give a greater portion, and to the fewer a less: to every one, as they have now been reckoned, shall possession be delivered: yet so that lot do divide the Land to the tribes and the families. Whatsoever shall chance by lot, that let either the more take, or the fewer. This also is the number of the sons of Levi by their families: Gerson, of whom the family of the Gersonites: Caath, of whom the family of the Caathites: Merari, of whom the family of the Merarites.

Howbeit Caath begat Amram: who had to wife Iochabed the daughter of Levi, who was born to him in Aegypt, She bare to Amram her husband sons, Aaron and Moyses, and Mary their sister. Of Aaron were born Nadab and Abiu, and Eleazar and Ithamar: of the which Nadab and Abiu died, when they had offered the strange fire before our Lord. And all that were numbered were twenty three thousand of the male kind from one month and upward: who were not reckoned among the children of Israel, neither was their possession given with the rest. This is the number of the children of Israel, that were enrolled by Moyses and Eleazar the Priest, in the champion country of Moab upon Jordan against Jericho. Among whom there was none of them that were numbered before by Moyses and Aaron in the desert of Sinai. For our Lord had foretold that all should die in the wilderness. And none remained of them, but Caleb the son of Jephone, and Josue the son of Nun.</div>
