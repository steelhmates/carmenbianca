			<div class='roleText'>Not as cruel will I raise him: for who can resist my countenance? Who hath given me before, that I may render unto him? All things that are under heaven be mine. I will not spare him, and his mighty words, and framed to beseech. Who shall reveal the face of his garment: and who shall enter into the midst of his mouth? Who shall open the gate of his countenance? Dread is round about his teeth. His body as shields that are cast, compact with scales fast cleaving together. One is joined to another, and not so much as any air entereth between them: One shall stick to another, and holding each other, they shall not be separated. His sneezing is as the shining of fire, and his eyes as the twinklings of the morning. Out of his mouth proceed lamps, as it were torches of lighted fire. Out of his nostrils proceedeth smoke, as it were of a pot heated and boiling. His breath maketh coals to burn, &amp; a flame cometh forth out of his mouth. In his neck shall strength abide, and neediness goeth before his face. The members of his flesh cleave together one to another: he shall send lightnings against him, and he shall not be carried to another place. His heart shall be hardened as a stone, and shall be stiffly compact as the smith's stithy. When he shall be taken away, the Angels shall fear, and being feared shall be purged. When the sword shall apprehend him, neither spear, nor breast-plate shall be able to abide. For he shall esteem iron as chaff, &amp; brass, as rotten wood. The bow-man shall not put him to flight, the stones of the sling, to him are turned into stubble. As stubble will he esteem the hammer, and he will laugh him to scorn that shaketh the spear. The beams of the sun shall be under him, &amp; he shall strew gold under him as durt. He shall make the deep sea to boil as a pot, and shall put it as when ointments boil. A path shall shine after him, he shall esteem the depth as waxing old. There is no power upon the earth, that may be compared with him, who is made to fear no man. He seeth every high thing, he is king over all the children of pride.</div>
