			<div class='roleText'>The Psalm of David, when he fled from the face of Absalom his son. Lord why are they multiplied that trouble me? Many rise up against me. Many say to my soul: There is no salvation for him in his God. But thou Lord art my protector, my glory, &amp; exalting my head. With my voice I have cried to our Lord: and he hath heard me from his holy hill. I have slept, and have been at rest; and have risen up, because our lord hath taken me. I will not fear thousands of people compassing me: arise Lord, save me my God. Because thou hast strucken all that are my adversaries without cause: thou hast broken the teeth of sinners. Salvation is our Lord's: and thy blessing upon thy people.</div>
