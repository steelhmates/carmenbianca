			<div class='roleText'>Through poverty many have offended: and he that seeketh to be made rich, turneth away his eye. As a stake is fastened in the midst of stones compact together, so also in the midst of selling and buying, sin shall be straitened. Sin shall be destroyed with the sinner. If thou hold not thyself instantly in the fear of our Lord, thy house shall quickly be subverted. As in the shaking of a sieve the dust will remain: so the perplexity of a man in his cogitation. The furnace trieth the potter's vessels, and the tentation of tribulation just men. As the husbandry about a tree sheweth the fruit thereof, so a word out of the thought of the heart of man. Praise not a man before full discourse, for this is the trial of men. If thou follow justice, thou shalt apprehend it: and shalt put it on as a long robe of honour, and thou shalt dwell with it: and it shall protect thee for ever, and in the day of acknowledging thou shalt find steadfastness. The fowls flock together to their like: and truth shall return to them that work it. The lion always lieth in wait for a prey: so sins for them that work iniquities. A holy man continueth in wisdom as the sun: for a fool is changed as the moon. In the midst of the unwise keep the word till his time: but in the midst of deep considerers be continually. The narration of sinners is odious, &amp; their laughter is in the delights of sin. Speech that sweareth much shall make the hair of the head to stand upright: and his lack of reverence is the stopping of the ears. Shedding of blood is in the brawling of the proud: and their cursing is a grievous hearing. He that discloseth the secret of a friend loseth credit, and he shall not find a friend to his mind. Love thy neighbour, and be joined with him in fidelity. But if thou discover his secrets, thou shalt not pursue after him. For as a man that loseth his friend, so also he that loseth the friendship of his neighbour. And as he that letteth a bird go out of his hand, so hast thou left thy neighbour, &amp; shalt not take him. Follow him not, because he is far absent, for he is fled, as a doe out of the snare: because his soul is wounded. Thou canst no more bind him, and of a curse there is reconciliation: but to disclose the secrets of a friend, is the desperation of an unhappy soul. He that winketh with the eye, forgeth wicked things, and no man will cast him off: in the sight of thine eyes he will sweeten his mouth, and will be in admiration upon thy words: but at the last he will pervert his mouth, and in thy words he will lay a scandal. I have heard many things, &amp; have not esteemed them equal to him, and our Lord will hate him. He that casteth a stone on high, it will fall upon his head: &amp; the deceitful stroke will divide the wounds of the deceitful. He that diggeth a pit, shall fall into it: and he that setteth a stone for his neighbour, shall stumble on it: &amp; he that layeth a snare for another, shall perish in it. To a man that doth most wicked counsel, it shall be turned upon himself, and he shall not know from whence it cometh to him. Derision &amp; reproach of the proud, and vengeance as a lion shall lie in wait for him. They shall perish in a snare that are delighted with the fall of the just: and sorrow shall consume them before they die. Anger and fury, both are execrable, and the sinful man shall be subject to them.</div>
