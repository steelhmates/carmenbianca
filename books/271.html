			<div class='roleText'>And Isboseth the son of Saul heard that Abner was slain in Hebron: and his hands were weakened, and all Israel was troubled. And the son of Saul had two men captains of robbers, the name of one Baana, &amp; the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rhemmon the Berothite of the sons of Benjamin: for Beroth also was accounted in Benjamin. And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were there strangers until that time. And Jonathas the son of Saul had a son lame in his feet: for he was five years old, when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathas from Jezrahel. His nurse therefore taking him, fled: and when she made haste to fly, he fell, &amp; was made lame: and he was called Miphiboseth. Therefore the sons of Rhemmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming, entered into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: who slept upon his bed at noon.
