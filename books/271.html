			<div class='roleText'>And Isboseth the son of Saul heard that Abner was slain in Hebron: and his hands were weakened, and all Israel was troubled. And the son of Saul had two men captains of robbers, the name of one Baana, &amp; the name of the other Rechab, the sons of Rhemmon the Berothite of the sons of Benjamin: for Beroth also was accounted in Benjamin. And the Berothites fled into Gethaim, and were there strangers until that time. And Jonathas the son of Saul had a son lame in his feet: for he was five years old, when the tidings came of Saul and Jonathas from Jezrahel. His nurse therefore taking him, fled: and when she made haste to fly, he fell, &amp; was made lame: and he was called Miphiboseth. Therefore the sons of Rhemmon the Berothite, Rechab and Baana coming, entered into the house of Isboseth in the heat of the day: who slept upon his bed at noon. And the Portress of the house that winnowed wheat, was asleep. And they entered into the house secretly taking ears of corn, and Rechab and Baana his brother struck him in privy parts and fled.

How much more now when wicked men have slain an innocent man in his own house, upon his bed, shall I not require his blood of your hand, and take you away from the earth? David therefore commanded his servants, and they slew them, and cutting off their hands and feet, hanged them over the pool in Hebron: but the head of Isboseth they took, and buried in the sepulchre of Abner in Hebron.</div>
