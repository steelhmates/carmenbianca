			<div class='roleText'>He that toucheth pitch, shall be defiled with it: and he that communicateth with the proud, shall put on pride. He shall take a burden upon him that communicateth with one more honourable than himself. And be not companion with one richer than thyself. What society shall the cauldron have with the earthen pot? For when they shall knock one against the other, it shall be broken. The rich man hath done unjustly, and he will fume: but the poor man being hurt will hold his peace. If thou give, he will take thee: and if thou have not, he will forsake thee. If thou have, he will live with thee, and will empty thee, and he will not be sorry for thee. If thou be necessary for him, he will supplant thee, and smiling will put thee in hope, telling thee good things, and will say: What wantest thou? And he will confound thee in his meats, till he empty thee twice &amp; thrice, and at the last he will mock thee: and afterward seeing he will forsake thee, and will shake his head at thee. Humble thyself to God, and expect his hands. Take heed lest seduced into folly thou be humbled. Be not humble in thy wisdom, lest humbled thou be seduced into folly. Being called of the mightier, depart: for by this he will call thee the more. Be not importune, lest thou be rejected: &amp; be not far from him, lest thou go into oblivion. Stay not to speak fellow-like with him: neither credit his many words. For by much talk he will prove thee, and smiling will examine thee of thy secrets. His cruel mind will keep thy words: and he will not spare for malice, and for bands. Take heed to thyself, and attend diligently to thine hearing: because thou walkest with thy subversion. But hearing those things see as it were in sleep, and thou shalt watch. Love God all thy life, and invocate him for thy salvation. Every beast loveth the like to it-self: so also every man the nearest to himself. All flesh will march with the like to it-self, &amp; every man will associate himself to his like. If the wolf shall at any time communicate with the lamb, so the sinner with the just. What fellowship hath an holy man with a dog, or what part hath the rich with the poor? The wild ass in the desert is the lion's prey: so the poor are also the pastures of the rich. And as humility is abomination to the proud: so also the poor man is the execration of the rich. The rich man being moved is confirmed by his friends: but the humble when he is fallen, shall be thrust out even of his familiars. To the rich deceived there are many recoverers: he hath spoken proud words, and they have justified him. The humble was deceived, he moreover is rebuked also: he hath spoken wisely, and place was not given unto him. The rich man spake, and all held their peace, and they will carry his word even to the clouds. The poor man spake and they say: Who is this? And if he stumble, they will overthrow him. Substance is good, to him that hath no sin in his conscience: and poverty is most wicked in the mouth of the impious. The heart of a man altereth his countenance, either into good, or into evil. The token of a good heart, and a good countenance thou shalt hardly find, and with labour.</div>
