			<div class='roleText'>And the word of our Lord was made to me, saying: Son of man, what shall be made of the wood of the vine of all the trees of the woods, that are among the trees of the forests? Shall there be taken wood of it, that a work may be made, or shall a pin be made thereof, that any vessel may hang thereon? Behold it is given to the fire for food: the fire hath consumed both parts thereof, and the midst thereof is brought into ashes: why, shall it be profitable for a work? Yea when it was whole, it was not fit for a work: how much more when the fire hath devoured, and burnt it, shall no work be made thereof? Therefore thus saith our Lord God: As the wood of the vine among the trees of the forests, which I have given to the fire to be devoured, so will I deliver the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And I will set my face against them: out of the fire shall they come forth, and fire shall consume them: and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall set my face against them, and shall make their land not passable, and desolate, because they have been prevaricators, saith our Lord God.</div>
