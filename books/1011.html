			<div class='roleText'>And it shall be: In the later end of days there shall be the mount of the house of our Lord prepared in the top of mountains, and high above the hills: &amp; peoples shall flow to it. And many nations shall hasten, &amp; shall say: Come, let us go up to the mountain of our Lord, &amp; to the house of the God of Jacob: &amp; he will teach us of his ways, &amp; we shall go in his paths: because out of Sion shall the law go forth, &amp; the word of our Lord out of Jerusalem. And he shall judge between many peoples, and he shall rebuke strong nations unto a far off: and they shall cut their swords into coulters, and their spears into spades: nation shall not take sword against nation: and they shall no more learn to make battle. And every man shall sit under his vine, and under his fig-tree, and there shall be none to make them afraid: because the mouth of the Lord of hosts hath spoken it. Because all peoples will walk every one in the name of his god: but we shall walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever. In that day, saith our Lord, I will gather her that halteth: and her that I had cast out, I will gather up, and her whom I had afflicted. And I will make her that halted into a remnant: and her that had laboured into a mighty nation: and our Lord will reign over them in mount Sion, from this time now &amp; for ever. And thou the tower of flock, cloudy of the daughter of Sion shall come to thee: and the first power shall come the kingdom to the daughter of Jerusalem. Now why art thou drawn together with pensiveness? Why, is there not a king to thee, or is thy counsellor perished, because sorrow hath apprehended thee as a woman in travail? Sorrow thou and labour o daughter of Sion, as a woman in travail: because now shalt thou go out of the city, &amp; shall dwell in the country, and shalt come even to Babylon, there thou shalt be delivered: there our Lord will redeem thee out of the hand of thine enemies. And now many nations are gathered together upon thee, which say: Let her be stoned: and let our eye look upon Sion. But they have not known the cogitations of our Lord, and have not understood his counsel: because he hath gathered them together as the hay of the floor. Arise, and thresh o daughter of Sion: because I will make thy horn of iron, and thy hoofs I will make of brass: and thou shalt break in pieces many peoples, and shalt kill the spoils of them to our Lord, and their strength to the Lord of the whole earth.</div>
