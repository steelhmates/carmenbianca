			<div class='roleText'>I have gone round about the earth, and walked through it. And our Lord said to Satan: Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is not the like to him in the earth, a man simple, and right, and fearing God, and departing from evil, and yet retaining innocency?

And his wife said to him: Doest thou yet continue in thy simplicity? Bless God and die. Who said to her: Thou hast spoken like one of the foolish women: if we have received good things of the hand of God, evil things why should we not receive? In all these things Job sinned not with his lips.

For they had appointed, that coming together they would visit him, and comfort him. And when they had lifted up their eyes a far off, they knew him not, and crying out they wept, and renting their cloths sprinkled dust over their head toward heaven. And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no man spake to him a word: for they saw the pain to be vehement.</div>
