			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. Praise ye our Lord in his holies: praise ye him in the firmament of his strength. Praise ye him in his powers: praise ye him according to the multitude of his greatness. Praise ye him in the sound of trumpet: praise ye him on psalter and harp. Praise ye him on timbrel and choir: praise ye him on strings and organ. Praise ye him on well sounding cymbals: praise ye him on cymbals of jubilation: let every spirit praise our Lord. Alleluia.</div>
