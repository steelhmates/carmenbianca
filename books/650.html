			<div class='roleText'>A Psalm of David for Jeremy. Upon the rivers of Babylon, there we sat and wept: whilst we remembered Sion. On the willows in the midst thereof, we hanged up our instruments. Because there they that led us captive, demanded of us words of songs. And they that led us away: Sing ye an hymn to us of the songs of Sion. How shall we sing the song of our Lord in a strange land? If I shall forget thee, o Jerusalem, let my right hand be forgotten. Let my tongue cleave to my jaws, if I do not remember thee: If I shall not set Jerusalem in the beginning of my joy. Be mindful, o Lord, of the children of Edom, in the day of Jerusalem: That say: Rase it, rase it, even unto the foundation thereof. Daughter of Babylon miserable: blessed is he, that shall repay thee thy payment, which thou hast payed us. Blessed is he that shall hold, and shall dash thy little ones against the rock.</div>
