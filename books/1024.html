			<div class='roleText'>This people saith: The time is not yet come of building the house of our Lord. And the word of our Lord was made in the hand of Aggeus the Prophet, saying: Why is it time for you to dwell in embowed houses, and this house desert? And now thus saith the Lord of hosts? Set your hearts upon your ways. You have sowed much, and brought in little: you have eaten, and have not been filled: you have drunk, and have not been inebriated: you have covered yourselves, and have not been warmed: and he that hath gathered the wages, put them into a broken bag. Thus saith the Lord of hosts: Set your hearts upon your ways: go up into the mountain, carry timber, and build the house: and it shall be acceptable to me, &amp; I shall be glorified, saith our Lord. You have looked for more, and behold it became less, and you brought it into the house, and I puft at it: for what cause saith the Lord of hosts? Because my house is desert, and you hasten every man into his own house. For this cause were the heavens stayed over you that they gave no dew, &amp; the earth was prohibited that it yielded not her spring: and I called a drought upon the earth, and upon the mountains, &amp; upon the wheat, &amp; upon the wine, and upon the oil, and what things soever the ground brought forth, and upon men, and upon beasts, and upon all the labour of the hands. And Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, and Jesus the son of Josedec the high Priest, and all the remnant of the people heard the voice of their God, and the words of Aggeus the Prophet, as our Lord their God sent him to them: and the people feared at the face of our Lord. And Aggeus the messenger of our Lord, of the messengers of our Lord spake, saying to the people: I am with you, saith our Lord. And our Lord raised up the spirit of Zorobabel the son of Salathiel Duke of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus the son of Josedec the grand Priest, and the spirit of the rest of all the people: and they went in, and did the work in the house of the Lord of hosts their God.</div>
