			<div class='roleText'>And after the wall was built, and I had put on the doors, and numbered the porters, and singing men, and Levites: I commanded Hanani my brother, and Hananias Prince of the house of Jerusalem (for he seemed as it were a true man, &amp; one that feared God above the rest) and I said to them: Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the heat of the sun. And when they yet stood by, the gates were shut, and barred: and I set watchmen of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one by their courses, and every man against his house. And the city was exceeding large and great, and the people few in the midst thereof, and there were no houses built. But God gave me in my heart, and I assembled the Princes and magistrates, and common people, that I might number them: and I found a Book of the number of them that came up first, and there was found written in it: These are the children of the province, which came up from the captivity of them that were transported, whom Nabuchodonosor the king of Babylon had transported, and returned into Jury, every one into his own city.

And Athersatha said to them, that they should not eat of the Holies of holies, until there stood up a Priest learned and cunning. All the multitude as it were one man^ forty two thousand three hundred sixty, beside their men-servants and women-servants, which were seven thousand three hundred thirty seven: and among them singing men, and singing women, two hundred forty five.

And the seventh month was come: and the children of Israel were in their cities.</div>
