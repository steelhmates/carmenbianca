			<div class='roleText'>AND the Pasch was, and the Azymes after two days: and the chief Priests and the Scribes sought how they might by some wile lay hands on him, and kill him. But they said: </div>

And when he was at Bethania in the house of Simon the Leper, and sat at meat, there came a woman having an alabaster box of ointment, of precious spike-nard; and breaking the alabaster-box, she poured it out upon his head. But there were certain that had indignation within themselves, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Whereto is this waste of the ointment made? For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred pence, and given to the poor. And they murmured against her. But JESUS said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Let her alone, why do you molest her? She hath wrought a good work upon me. For the poor you have always with you; and when you will, you may do them good; but me you have not always. That which she had, she hath done; she hath prevented to anoint my body to the burial. Amen I say to you, wheresoever this Gospel shall be preached in the whole world, that also which she hath done, shall be told for a memory of her. And Judas Iscariote one of the Twelve went his way to the chief Priests, for to betray him to them. Who hearing it, were glad; and they promised him that they would give him money. And he sought how he might betray him conveniently. And the first day of the Azymes when they sacrificed the Pasch, the Disciples say to him: Whither wilt thou that we go, and prepare for thee to eat the Pasch? And he sendeth two of his Disciples, and saith to them: Go ye into the city; and there shall meet you a man carrying a pitcher of water, follow him; and whithersoever he entereth, say to the Master of the house, that the Master saith, where is my refectory, where I may eat the Pasch with my Disciples? And he will shew you a great chamber, adorned; and there prepare for us. And his Disciples went their ways, and came into the city; and they found as he had told them, and they prepared the Pasch. And when even was come, he cometh with the Twelve. And when they were sitting at the table and eating, JESUS said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Amen I say to you, that one of you shall betray me, he that eateth with me. But they began to be sad, and to say to him severally, Is it I? Who said to them: One of the Twelve, he that dippeth with me his hand in the dish. And the Son of man indeed goeth, as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of man shall be betrayed. It were good for him, if that man had not been born. And whiles they were eating, JESUS took bread: and blessing brake, and gave to them, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Take, THIS IS MY BODY. And taking the chalice, giving thanks he gave to them. And they all drank of it. And he said to them: THIS IS MY BLOOD OF THE NEW TESTAMENT, THAT SHALL BE SHED FOR MANY. Amen I say to you, that now I will not drink of the fruit of the vine until that day when I shall drink it new in the Kingdom of God. And an hymn being said, they went forth into Mount-olivet. And JESUS saith to them: You shall all be scandalized in me in this night; for it is written, I will strike the Pastor, &amp; the sheep shall be dispersed. But after that I shall be risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. And Peter said to him: Although all shall be scandalized, yet not I. And JESUS saith to him: Amen I say to thee, that thou this day in this night, before the cock crow twice, shalt thrice deny me. But he spake more vehemently: Although I should die together with thee, I will not deny thee. And in like manner also said they all. And they come into a farm-place called Gethsemani. And he saith to his Disciples: Sit you here, until I pray. And he taketh Peter and James and John with him; and he began to fear and to be heavy. And he saith to them: My soul is sorrowful even unto death; stay here, and watch. And when he was gone forward a little, he fell flat upon the ground; and he prayed that if it might be, the hour might pass from him; and he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Abba, Father, all things are possible to thee, transfer this chalice from me, but not that which I will, but that which thou. And he cometh, and findeth them sleeping. And he saith to Peter: Simon, sleepest thou? couldst thou not watch one hour? Watch ye, and pray that you enter not into tentation. The spirit indeed is prompt, but the flesh infirm. And going away again, he prayed, saying the self same word. And returning, again he found them asleep (for their eyes were heavy) and they wist not what they should answer him. And he cometh the third time, and saith to them: Sleep ye now, and take rest. It sufficeth: the hour is come; behold the Son of man shall be betrayed into the hands of sinners. Arise, let us go. Behold, he that shall betray me, is at hand. And as he was yet speaking, cometh Judas Iscariote one of the Twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and clubs, from the chief Priests and the Scribes and the Ancients. And the betrayer of him had given them a sign, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Whomsoever I shall kiss, it is he, lay hold on him, and lead him warily. And when he was come, immediately going to him, he saith: Rabbi, and he kissed him. But they laid hands upon him, and held him. And one certain man of the standers about, drawing out a sword, smote the servant of the chief Priest, and cut off his ear. And JESUS answering, said to them: As to a thief you come out with swords and clubs to apprehend me? I was daily with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hands on me. But, that the Scriptures may be fulfilled. Then his Disciples leaving him, all fled. And a certain young man followed him clothed with sindon upon the bare; and they took him. But he casting off the sindon, fled from them naked. And they brought JESUS to the chief Priest; and all the Priests and the Scribes and the Ancients assembled together. And Peter followed him a far off even in unto the court of the high Priest; and he sat with the servants at the fire, and warmed himself. And the chief Priests and all the Council sought testimony against JESUS, that they might put him to death, neither found they. For many spake false witness against him; and the testimonies were not convenient. And certain rising up, bare false witness against him, saying: That we heard him say, I will dissolve this temple made with hand, and in three days will I build another not made with hand. And their testimony was not convenient. And the high Priest rising up into the midst, asked JESUS, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Answerest thou nothing to these things that are objected to thee of these? But he held his peace and answered nothing. Again the high Priest asked him, and said to him: Art thou Christ the Son of the blessed God? And JESUS saith to him: I am. And you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of Heaven. And the high Priest renting his garments, saith: What need we witnesses any further? You have heard blasphemy. How think you? Who all condemned him to be guilty of death. And certain began to spit upon him, and to cover his face, and to beat him with buffets, and to say unto him, Prophesy; and the servants gave him blows. And when Peter was in the court beneath, there cometh one of the woman-servants of the high Priest. And when she had seen Peter warming himself, beholding him she saith: And thou wast with JESUS of Nazareth. But he denied, saying: </div>

And again a wench seeing him, began to say to the standers about, That this fellow is of them. But he denied again. And after a while again^ they that stood by, said to Peter: Verily thou art of them; for thou art also a Galilaean. But he began to curse and to swear, That I know not this man whom you speak of. And immediately the cock crew again. And Peter remembered the word that JESUS had said unto him: Before the cock crow twice, thou shalt thrice deny me. And he began to weep.</div>
