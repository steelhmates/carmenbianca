			<div class='roleText'>But this also shalt thou do, that they may be consecrated to me in priesthood. Take a calf from the herd, and two rams without spot, and unleavened bread, and a cake without leaven, tempered with oil, wafers also unleavened anointed with oil: of wheaten flour thou shalt make all. And: being put in a basket thou shalt offer them: and the calf and the two rams. And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons to the door of the tabernacle of testimony: And when thou hast washed the father with his sons in water, thou shalt vest Aaron with his vestments, that is, with the linen garment and the tunic, and the Ephod and the Rationale, which thou shalt gird with the bawdrike. And thou shalt put the mitre upon his head, and the holy plate upon the mitre, and thou shalt pour the oil of unction upon his head: and by this rite shall he be consecrated. His sons also thou shalt bring, and shalt invest them with the linen tunics, and gird them with a bawdrike, to wit, Aaron and his children, and thou shalt put mitres upon them: and they shall be Priests to me by a perpetual religion. After that thou shalt have consecrated their hands, thou shalt present also the calf before the tabernacle of testimony. And Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands upon his head, and thou shalt kill him in the sight of the Lord, beside the door of the tabernacle of testimony. And that which thou takest of the blood of the calf, thou shalt put upon the horns of the Altar with thy finger, and the rest of the blood thou shalt pour at the bottom thereof. Thou shalt take also the whole fat that covereth the entrails, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, and shalt offer a burnt sacrifice upon the Altar: but the flesh of the calf and the hide and the dung, thou shalt burn abroad without the camp, because it is for sin. Thou shalt take also one ram, upon the head whereof Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands. Which when thou hast killed, thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and pour round about the Altar. And the ram itself thou shalt cut into pieces, and his entrails and feet being washed, thou shalt put upon the flesh cut in pieces, and upon his head. And thou shalt offer the whole ram for a burnt sacrifice upon the Altar: it is an oblation to the Lord, a most sweet savour of the victim of the Lord. Thou shalt take also the other ram, upon whose head Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands. Which when thou hast immolated, thou shalt take of his blood, and put upon the tip of the right ear of Aaron and of his sons, and upon the thumbs and great toes of their right hand and foot, and thou shalt pour the blood upon the Altar round about. And when thou hast taken of the blood that is upon the Altar, and of the oil of unction, thou shalt sprinkle Aaron and his vesture, his sons and their vestments. And after they and their vestments are consecrated, thou shalt take the fat of the ram, and the tail and the tallow, that covereth the lungs, and the caul of the liver, and the two kidneys, and the fat, that is upon them, and the right shoulder, because it is the ram of consecration: and a piece of one loaf, a cake tempered with oil, a wafer out of the basket of azymes, which is set in the sight of the Lord: and thou shalt put all upon the hands of Aaron and of his sons, and shalt sanctify them elevating before the Lord. And thou shalt take all from their hands: and shalt burn them upon the Altar for an holocaust, a most sweet savour in the sight of the Lord, because it is his oblation. Thou shalt take also the breast of the ram, wherewith Aaron was consecrated, and elevating it thou shalt sanctify it before the Lord, and it shall fall to thy part. And thou shalt sanctify both the consecrated breast, and the shoulder that thou didst separate of the ram, wherewith Aaron was consecrated and his sons, and they shall fall to Aaron's part and his sons by a perpetual right from the children of Israel: because they are the primitives and beginnings of their pacific victims which they offer to the Lord. And the holy vesture, which Aaron shall use, his sons shall have after him, that they may be anointed, and their hands consecrated in it. He of his sons that shall be appointed High-Priest in his stead, and that shall enter into the tabernacle of testimony to minister in the Sanctuary, shall wear it seven days. And thou shalt take the ram of the consecration, &amp; shalt boil the flesh thereof in a holy place; which Aaron shalt eat and his sons. The loaves also, that are in the basket, they shall eat in the entry of the tabernacle of testimony, that it may be a placable sacrifice, &amp; the hands of the offerers may be sanctified. A stranger shall not eat of them, because they are holy. And if there remain of the consecrated flesh, or of the bread till the morning, thou shalt burn the remains with fire: they shall not be eaten, because they are sanctified. All that I have commanded thee thou shalt do upon Aaron and his sons. Seven days shalt thou consecrate their hands: &amp; thou shalt offer a calf for sin every day for expiation. And thou shalt cleanse the Altar when thou hast offered the host of expiation, and shalt anoint it unto sanctification. Seven days shalt thou expiate the altar and sanctify it, and it shall be most Holy, every one, that shall touch it, shall be sanctified. This is it which thou shalt do upon the Altar: Two lambs of a year old every day continually, one lamb in the morning, and another at even, the tenth part of flour tempered with oil beaten, which shall have in measure the fourth part of an hin, and wine for libation of the same measure to one lamb. And the other lamb thou shalt offer at even, according to the rite of the morning oblation, and according to that which we have said, for a savour of sweetness: it is a sacrifice to the Lord, by perpetual oblation unto your generations, at the door of the tabernacle of testimony before the Lord, where I will appoint to speak unto thee. And there will I command the children of Israel, and the Altar shall be sanctified in my glory. I will sanctify also the tabernacle of testimony with the Altar &amp; Aaron with his sons, to do the function of priesthood unto me. And I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel &amp; will be their God, &amp; they shall know that I am the Lord their God, that have brought them out of the Land of Aegypt, that I might abide among them, I^ the Lord their God.</div>
