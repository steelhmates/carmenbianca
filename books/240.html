			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in those days, the Philisthiims assembled together to fight: and Israel went forth to meet the Philisthiims into battle, &amp; camped beside the Stone of help. Moreover the Philisthiims came into Aphec, &amp; put their army in array against Israel. And after they had joined battle, Israel turned their backs to the Philisthiims: and there were slain in the fight here &amp; there through the fields, as it were four thousand men. And the people returned to the camp: &amp; the ancients of Israel said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why hath our Lord struck us today before the Philisthiims? Let us fetch unto us the ark of the covenant of our Lord from Silo, and let it come into the midst of us, that it may save us from the hand of our enemies. The people therefore sent into Silo, and they took from thence the ark of the covenant of the Lord of hosts sitting upon the Cherubims: and the two sons of Heli were with the ark of the covenant of God, Ophni and Phinees. And when the ark of the covenant of our Lord was come into the camp, all Israel made a shout with a great cry, and the earth sounded. And the Philisthiims heard the voice of the cry, &amp; said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What is this voice of a great cry in the camp of the Hebrews? And they knew that the ark of our lord was come into the camp. And the Philisthiims were afraid, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>God is come into the camp. And they mourned, saying: Woe to us: for there was no so great rejoicing yesterday and the day before: woe to us. Who shall keep us from the hand of these high gods? These be the gods that struck Aegypt with all plague, in the desert. Take courage, &amp; be men, ye Philisthiims: lest you be servants to the Hebrews, as they also have served you: take courage &amp; fight. The Philisthiims therefore fought, and Israel was slain, and every man fled into his tabernacle: and there was made an exceeding great plague: and there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken: the two sons also of Heli died, Ophni and Phinees. And a man of Benjamin running out of the battle array, came into Silo that day, his garment rent, and sprinkled on his head with dust. And when he was come, Heli sat upon a stool over against the way looking. For his heart was fearful for the ark of God. And that man after he was entered in, told it to the city: and all the city howled. And Heli heard the sound of the cry, and said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What is this sound of this same tumult? But he hastened, and came, and told Heli. And Heli was ninety and eight years old, &amp; his eyes were dim, and he could not see. And he said to Heli: I am he that came from the battle, &amp; I he that fled out of the field this day. To whom he said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>What is done my son? And he brought the news answering: Israel, quoth he, is fled before the Philisthiims, and a great ruin is made in the people: moreover also thy two sons are dead, Ophni &amp; Phinees: &amp; the ark of God is taken. And when he had named the ark of God, he fell from his stool backward beside the door, &amp; his neck being broken he died. For he was an old man, &amp; of a great age: &amp; he judged Israel forty years. And his daughter in law, the wife of Phinees, was great with child, &amp; nigh to be delivered: &amp; hearing the report that the ark of God was taken, &amp; her father in law was dead, &amp; her husband, she bowed herself &amp; was delivered: for sudden pains were fallen upon her. And in the very moment of her death, they said to her that stood about her: Fear not, because thou hast born a son. Who answered them not, nor gave heed to it. And she called the child Ichabod, saying: </div>
