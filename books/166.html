			<div class='roleText'>If there rise in the midst of thee a Prophet, or one that saith he hath seen a dream, and foretell a sign and a wonder, and it come to pass which he spake, and he say to thee: Let us go, and follow strange gods, which thou knowest not, and let us serve them: thou shalt not hear the words of that Prophet or dreamer: for the Lord your God tempteth you, that it may appear whether you love him or not, with all your heart, and with all your soul. Follow the Lord your God, and fear him, and keep his commandments, and hear his voice: him you shall serve, and to him you shall cleave. And that Prophet or forger of dreams shall be slain: because he spake that he might avert you from the Lord your God, which brought you out of the Land of Aegypt, and redeemed you from the house of servitude: that he might make thee to err from the way, that the Lord thy God commanded thee: and thou shalt take away the evil out of the midst of thee. If thy brother the son of thy mother, or thy son or daughter, or thy wife that is in thy bosom, or thy friend, whom thou lovest as thy soul, will persuade thee secretly, saying: Let us go, and serve strange gods, which thou knowest not, nor thy fathers, of all nations round about, that be nigh or far, from the beginning unto the end of the earth, consent not to him, nor hear him, neither let thine eye spare him to pity and hide him, but forthwith thou shalt kill him. Let thy hand be first upon him, and after thee all the people lay hand on him. With stones shall he be stoned to death: because he would have withdrawn thee from the Lord thy God, which brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt, from the house of servitude: that all Israel hearing may fear, and may do no more any thing like to this. If in one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God shall give thee to inhabit, thou hear some say: There are gone forth children of Belial out of the midst of thee, and have averted the inhabitants of their city, and have said: Let us go, and serve strange gods which you know not: inquire carefully, and diligently, the truth of the thing being looked into, if thou find it certain that is said, and that this abomination is in act committed, thou shalt forthwith strike the inhabitants of that city in the edge of the sword, and shalt destroy it and all things that are in it, unto the very beasts. What stuff also soever there is, thou shalt gather together in the midst of the streets thereof, and shalt burn it with the city it-self, so that thou consume all things to the Lord thy God, and it be a heap for ever: it shall be built no more, and there shall nothing stick in thy hand of that anathema: that our Lord may be turned from the wrath of his fury, and may have mercy on thee, and multiply thee as he sware to thy fathers, when thou shalt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, keeping all his precepts, which I command thee this day, that thou mayest do that which is pleasing in the sight of the Lord thy God.</div>
