			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, for them that shall be changed, testimony to Asaph, a Psalm. Thou that rulest Israel, attend: that conductest Joseph as a sheep. Which sittest upon the Cherubs, be manifest before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasses. Raise up thy might, and come to save us. O God convert us: and shew thy face, &amp; we shall be saved. O Lord the God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry upon the prayer of thy servant? Thou wilt feed us with the bread of tears: and give us drink with tears in measure. Thou hast made us to be a contradiction to our neighbours: and our enemies have scorned us. O God of hosts convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be saved. Thou didst transport the vineyard out of Aegypt: thou didst cast out the Gentiles, and plantedst it. Thou wast the guide of the way, in the sight thereof: thou didst plant the roots thereof, and it filled the earth. The shadow of it covered the mountains: and the boughs of it the cedars of God. It extended her branches even to the sea; and her boughs unto the river. Why hast thou destroyed the hedge thereof: and all that pass by the way do pluck it. The boar of the wood hath destroyed it: and the singular wild beast hath eaten it. O God of hosts return: regard from heaven, and see, and visit this vineyard. And perfit it, which thy right hand hath planted: and upon the son of man whom thou hast confirmed to thee. Things burnt with fire, and digged down at the increpation of thy countenance shall perish. Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand: and upon the son of man, whom thou hast confirmed to thee. And we depart not from thee, thou wilt quicken us: and we will invocate thy name. O Lord the God of hosts convert us: and shew thy face, and we shall be saved.</div>
