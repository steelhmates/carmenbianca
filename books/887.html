			<div class='roleText'>And it came to pass in the fourth year of Joakim, the son of Josias king of Juda: this word was made to Jeremy from our Lord, saying: Take a volume of a book and thou shalt write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel &amp; Juda, and against all Nations since the day that I spake to thee, from the days of Josias even to this day. If perhaps the house of Juda hearing all the evils, that I mean to do unto them, let every man return from his most wicked way: and I will be propitious to their iniquity, and to their sin. Jeremy therefore called Baruch the son of Nerias: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremy all the words of our Lord, which he spake to him, in the volume of the book. And Jeremy commanded Baruch, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I am shut up, neither am I able to go into the house of our Lord. Go thou in therefore, and read out of the volume, wherein thou hast written from my mouth the words of our Lord, in the hearing of all the people in the house of our Lord on the fasting day: moreover also in the hearing of all Juda, which come out of their cities, thou shalt read it to them: if perhaps their prayer may fall in the sight of our Lord, and every one return from his most wicked way: because great is the fury and indignation, which our Lord hath spoken against this people. And Baruch the son of Nerias did according to all things, that Jeremy the Prophet had commanded him, reading out of the volume the words of our Lord in the house of our Lord. And it came to pass in the fifth year of Joakim the son of Josias the king of Juda, in the ninth month: they proclaimed a fast in the sight of our Lord to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the multitude, that was flocked together out of the cities of Juda in Jerusalem. And Baruch read out of the words of Jeremy in the house of our Lord, in the treasury of Gamarias the son of Saphan the scribe, in the higher court, in the entry of the new gate of the house of our Lord, all the people hearing it. And when Micheas the son of Gamarias the son of Saphan had heard all the words of our Lord out of the book: he went down into the king's house to the treasury of the scribe: and behold all the Princes sat there, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaias the son of Semeias, and Elnathan the son of Achobor: and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedecias the son of Hananias, and all the Princes. And Micheas told them all the words that he had heard Baruch reading out of the volume in the ears of the people. All the Princes therefore sent to Baruch, Judi the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Take in thy hand the volume, out of which thou hast read in the hearing of the people, &amp; come. Baruch therefore the son of Nerias took the volume in his hand &amp; came to them. And they said to him: Sit, and read these things in our ears. And Baruch read in their ears. Therefore when they had heard all the words, they were astonished every one toward his neighbour, and they said to Baruch: We must tell the king all these words. And they asked him, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Tell us how didst thou write all these words from his mouth. And Baruch said to them: From his mouth he spake as it were reading unto me all these words, and I wrote in a volume with ink. And the Princes said to Baruch: Go, &amp; be hid thou &amp; Jeremy, and let no man know where you are. And they went to the king into the court: moreover they laid up the volume in the treasury of Elisama the scribe: and they told all the words in the hearing of the king. And the king sent Judi, that he should take the volume: who taking it out of the treasury of Elisama the scribe, read it, the king hearing, and all the Princes, that stood about the king. And the king sat in the winter house in the ninth month: and there was an hearth set before him full of burning coals. And when Judi had read three or four pages, he cut it with the penknife of a scribe: and he cast it into the fire, that was upon the hearth, till all the volume was consumed with the fire, that was on the hearth. And the king and all his servants, that heard all these words, did not fear, nor rent their garments. But yet Elnathan, and Dalaias, and Gamarias gainsaid the king, not to burn the Book: and he heard them not. And the king commanded Jeremiel the son of Amelech, and Saraias the son of Ezriel, and Selemias the son of Abdeel, that they should apprehend Baruch the scribe, and Jeremy the Prophet: but our Lord hid them. And the word of our Lord was made to Jeremy the Prophet, after that the king had burnt the volume and the words, that Baruch had written from the mouth of Jeremy, saying: Again take another volume: and write in it all the former words, that were in the first volume, which Joakim the king of Juda hath burnt. And to Joakim the king of Juda thou shalt say: Thus saith our Lord: Thou hast burnt that volume, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Why hast thou written in it telling: The king of Babylon will come in haste, and will waste this land: and he will make man and beast, to cease out of it? Therefore thus saith our Lord against Joakim the king of Juda: There shall not be of him to sit upon the throne of David: and his carcass shall be cast forth to the heat by day, and to the frost by night. And I will visit against him, and against his seed, and against his servants their iniquities, and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, &amp; upon the men of Juda all the evil, that I have spoken to them: and they have not heard. And Jeremy took another volume, and gave it to Baruch the son of Nerias the scribe: who wrote in it from the mouth of Jeremy all the words of the book, which Joakim the king of Juda had burnt with fire: &amp; there were added moreover many more words, than had been before.</div>
