			<div class='roleText'>The burden of the word of our Lord in the land of Hadrach, &amp; Damascus his rest: because our Lord is the eye of man, and of all the tribes of Israel. Emath also in the borders thereof, &amp; Tyre, &amp; Sidon: for they have taken to themselves wisdom exceedingly. And Tyre hath built her munition, and heaped together silver as earth, and gold as the mire of the streets. Behold our Lord shall possess her, and shall strike her strength in the sea, &amp; she shall be devoured with fire. Ascalon shall see, and shall fear, and Gaza, and shall be sorry exceedingly: &amp; Accaron, because her hope is confounded: and the king shall perish out of Gaza, &amp; Ascalon shall not be inhabited. And the separator shall sit in Azotus, and I will destroy the pride of the Philistiims. And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his abominations out of the midst of his teeth: and he also shall be left to our God, and he shall be as a duke in Juda, &amp; Accaron as a Jebuseite. And I will environ my house of them, that serve me in warfare going and returning, &amp; the exactor shall no more pass over them: because now I have seen with mine eyes. Rejoice greatly, o daughter of Sion, make jubilation, o daughter of Jerusalem: BEHOLD THY KING will come to thee, the just &amp; saviour: himself poor, and riding upon an ass, and upon a colt the foal of an ass. And I will destroy chariot out of Ephraim, and horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be dissipated: and he shall speak peace to the Gentiles, and his power from sea even to sea, and from the rivers even to the end of the earth. Thou also in the blood of thy testament hast let forth thy prisoners out of the lake, wherein is no water. Convert to the munition ye prisoners of hope, today also declaring I will render thee double. Because I have bent Juda for me as a bow, I have filled Ephraim: and I will raise up thy sons o Sion upon thy sons o Greece, and I will make thee as the sword of the strong. And our Lord God shall be seen over them, and his dart shall go forth as lightning: and our Lord God will sound with trumpet, and will go in the whirlwind of the South. The Lord of hosts will protect them: and they shall devour, and subdue with the stones of the sling: and drinking they shall be drunk as it were of wine, &amp; they shall be filled as phials, and the horns of the altar. And our Lord their God will save them in that day, as the flock of his people: because holy stones shall be elevated over his land. For what is his good thing, and what is his beautiful thing, but the corn of the elect, and wine springing virgins?</div>
