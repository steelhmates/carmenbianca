			<div class='roleText'>A deceitful balance, is abomination before God: and an equal weight is his will. Where pride shall be, there shall be contumely also: but where humility, there also wisdom. The simplicity of the just shall direct them: and the supplanting of the perverse shall waste them. Riches shall not profit in the day of revenge: but justice shall deliver from death. The justice of the simple shall direct his way: and the impious shall fall in his impiety. The justice of the righteous shall deliver them: and the unjust shall be caught in their deceitful practices. The impious man being dead, there shall be no hope any more: and the expectation of the careful shall perish. The just is delivered from distress: and the impious shall be given for him. The dissembler with his mouth deceiveth his friend: but the just shall be delivered by knowledge. In the good things of the just the city shall rejoice; and in the destruction of the impious there shall be praise. With the benediction of the just the city shall be exalted: and by the mouth of the impious it shall be subverted. He that despiseth his friend, lacketh heart: but the wise man will hold his peace. He that walketh fraudulently, revealeth secrets: but he that is faithful, concealeth the thing committed of his friend. Where there is no governor, the people shall fall: but there is health where is much counsel. He shall be afflicted with evil, that is surety for a stranger: but he that is ware of the snares, shall be secure. A gracious woman shall find glory: and the strong shall have riches. A merciful man doth good to his kindred also. Benefacit animae suae vir misericors; qui autem crudelis est, etiam propinquos abjicit. The impious maketh an unstable work: but to him that soweth justice, is a faithful reward. Clemency prepareth life: &amp; the pursuing of evil things death. A perverse heart is abominable to our Lord: and his will is in them that walk simply. Hand in hand the evil man shall not be innocent: but the seed of the just shall be saved. A ring of gold in a swine's snout, a fair woman &amp; a fool. The desire of the just is all good: the expectation of the impious fury. Some divide their own goods, and are made richer: others take violently not their own, and are always in poverty. The soul which blesseth, shall be made fat: and he that inebriateth himself shall also be inebriated. He that hideth corn, shall be cursed among the peoples: but blessing upon the head of them that sell. Well riseth he early who seeketh good things: but he that is a searcher after evil things, shall be oppressed of them. He that trusteth in his riches shall fall: but the just shall spring as a green leaf. He that troubleth his house, shall possess the winds: and he that is a fool shall serve the wise. The fruit of the just man a tree of life: and he that gaineth souls, is wise. If the just man receive in the earth, how much more the impious and sinner?</div>
