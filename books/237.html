			<div class='roleText'>There was a man of Ramathaimsophim, of mount Ephraim, &amp; his name Elcana, the son of Jeroham, the son of Eliu, the son of Thohu, the son of Suph, an Ephraite: and he had two wives, the name of one was Anna, and the name of the second Phenenna. Phenenna had children: but Anna had not children. And that man went up from his city upon ordinary days, to adore and sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts in Silo. And there were the two sons of Heli, Ophni and Phinees, Priests of our Lord. The day came therefore, &amp; Elcana immolated, and gave to Phenenna his wife, &amp; to all her sons and daughters parts: but to Anna he gave one part with heavy cheer, because he loved Anna. And our Lord had shut her matrice. Her adversary also afflicted her, and vexed her sore, in so much that she upbraided her, that our Lord had shut her matrice: and so did she every year, when the time returned, that they went up to the temple of our Lord: and so she provoked her: moreover she wept, and took not meat. Elcana therefore her husband said to her: Anna, why weepest thou? And why dost thou not eat? And wherefore dost thou afflict thy heart? Am not I better to thee, than ten children? And Anna arose after she had eaten and drunk in Silo. And Heli the Priest sitting upon a Stool before the posts of the house of our Lord, whereas Anna had a heavy heart, she prayed to our Lord, weeping aboundantly, and she vowed a vow, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>O Lord of hosts, if regarding thou wilt behold the affliction of thy servant, and wilt be mindful of me, and not forget thy handmaid, and wilt give unto thy servant a man child: I will give him to our Lord all the days of his life, &amp; the razor shall not come upon his head. And it came to pass, when she multiplied prayers before our Lord, that Heli observed her mouth. Moreover Anna spake in her heart, and only her lips moved, and voice there was not heard at all. Heli therefore thought her to be drunk, and said to her: How long wilt thou be drunk? Digest a little the wine, wherewith thou art wet. Anna answering, Not so, quoth she, my Lord: for I am an exceeding unhappy woman, and wine and whatsoever may inebriate, I have not drunk, but I have poured out my soul in the sight of our Lord. Account not thy handmaid as one of the daughters of Belial: for of the multitude of my sorrow and heaviness have I spoken until this present. Then Heli said to her: Go in peace: and the God of Israel give thee thy petition, which thou hast asked him. But she said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Would God thy handmaid may find grace in thine eyes. And the woman went on her way, and did eat, and her countenance was no more changed otherwise. And they rose in the morning, and adored before our Lord: and they returned, &amp; came into their house to Ramatha. And Elcana knew Anna his wife: and our Lord remembered her. And it came to pass after a certain compass of days, Anna conceived &amp; bare a son, and called his name Samuel: because she asked him of our Lord. And Elcana her husband went up, and all her house, to immolate unto our Lord the solemn host, and his vow, and Anna went not up: for she said to her husband: I will not go till the infant be weaned, and till I may bring him, that he may appear before the sight of our Lord, and may remain there continually. And Elcana her husband said to her. Do that which seemeth good to thee, and tarry till thou wean him: and I pray that our Lord fulfill his word. The woman therefore tarried, and gave her son suck, till she removed him from the milk. And she brought him with her, after she had weaned him, with three calves, &amp; three bushels of meal, and a flagon of wine, and she brought him to the house of our Lord in Silo. But the child was yet a little infant: and they immolated a calf, and offered the child to Heli. And Anna said: </div>

For this child did I pray, and our Lord hath given me my petition, which I asked him. Therefore I also have given him to our Lord all the days, which he shall live, that he may be applied to our Lord. And they adored our Lord there. And Anna prayed, and said:</div>
