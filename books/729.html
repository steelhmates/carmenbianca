			<div class='roleText'>Again another thinking to sail, and beginning to make a journey through the fierce waves, invocateth wood more frail than the wood that carrieth him. For covetousness of getting invented it, and the craftsman by his wisdom framed it. But thy providence, o Father, doth govern: because thou hast given a way even in the sea, and among the waves a most sure path, shewing that thou art able to save out of all things, yea if a man go to the sea without art. But that thy works might not be void of wisdom: for this cause also men commit their lives even to a little wood, and passing over the sea are delivered by ship. But from the beginning also when the proud giants perished, the hope of the world flying to a ship, rendered to the world seed of nativity, which was governed by thy hand. For blessed is the wood, by the which justice is made. But the idol that is made by hands, cursed is both it, and he that made it: because he indeed wrought it: and the same being frail, was called God. But to God the impious and his impiety are odious alike. For that which is made, with him that made it, shall suffer torments. For this cause also in the idol of the nations there shall be no respect: because the creatures of God were made to hatred, and for tentation to the souls of men, and for a snare to the feet of the unwise. For the beginning of fornication is the devising of idols: and the inventing of them is the corruption of life. For neither were they from the beginning, neither shall they be for ever. For this vanity of men came into the world: and therefore there is found a short end of them. For the father being sorrowful with bitter mourning, made unto himself the image of his son quickly taken away: and him, that then was a dead man, now he began to worship as God, and appointed holy things and sacrifices among his servants. Afterward by succession of time, the wicked custom prevailing, this error was kept as a law, and things graven were worshipped by the commandment of Tyrants. And those, whom openly men could not honour, for that they were far off, their figure being brought from a far, they made an evident image of the king, whom they would honour: that by their carefulness they might honour as present, him that was absent. And to the worshipping of these, the excellent diligence also of the artificer, holp them forward, that were ignorant. For he willing to please him that entertained him, laboured by his art to fashion the similitude in better sort. And the multitude of men carried away by the beauty of the work, him that a little before had been honoured as a man, now they esteemed for a God. And this was the deceiving of man's life: because men serving either affection, or kings, gave the name that is not communicable, to stones and wood. And it was not sufficient that they erred about the knowledge of God, but also living in a great battle of ignorance, so many and so great evils they call peace. For either sacrificing their children, or making obscure sacrifices, or having watches full of madness, they now neither keep life, nor marriage clean, but one killeth another by envy, or playing the adulterer maketh him sorrowful: and all things are mingled together, blood, manslaughter, theft and fiction, corruption and infidelity, trouble and perjury, disquieting of the good, forgetfulness of God, inquination of souls, immutation of nativity, inconstancy of marriage, disorder of adultery, and unchasteness. For the worship of idols not to be named, is the cause of all evil, and the beginning and end. For either when they rejoice, they are mad: or certes prophesy false things, or live unjustly, or quickly forswear themselves. For whilst they trust in idols, which are without soul, swearing amiss they hope not to be hurt. Two evil things therefore shall happen to them worthily, because they have thought evil of God, attending to idols, and have sworn unjustly, in guile contemning justice. For it is not the power of them that are sworn by, but the punishment of them that sin goeth always through the transgression of the unjust.</div>
