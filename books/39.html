			<div class='roleText'>Therefore Joseph was brought into Aegypt, and Putiphar an Eunuch of Pharao, Prince of his army, a man of Aegypt bought him, at the hand of the Ismaelites, by whom he was brought. And our Lord was with him, and he was a man that in all things did prosperously: and he dwelt in his master's house, who knew very well that our Lord was with him, and that all things which he did were directed by him in his hand. And Joseph found grace before his master, and ministered to him: by whom being made ruler over all his things, he governed the house committed to him, and all things that were delivered unto him: and our Lord blessed the house of the Aegyptian for Joseph's sake, and multiplied as well in houses, as in lands all his substance. Neither knew he any other thing, but the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was of beautiful countenance, and comely favoured to behold. After many days therefore his Mistress cast her eyes on Joseph, and said: </div>

And our Lord was with Joseph, and having mercy upon him gave him grace in the sight of the chief of the prison. Who delivered in his hand all the prisoners that were kept in custody: and whatsoever was done, was under him. Neither did himself know anything, having committed all things to him: for our Lord was with him, and directed all his works.</div>
