			<div class='roleText'>At that time, saith our Lord: I will be the God of all the kindreds of Israel, and they shall be my people. Thus saith our Lord: The people that remained from the sword, found grace in the desert: Israel shall go to his rest. Our Lord hath appeared to me of long time. And in everlasting charity have I loved thee, therefore have I drawn thee taking compassion. And I will build thee again, and thou shalt be builded o virgin Israel: thou shalt yet be adorned with thy timbrels, &amp; shall go forth in the choir of them that play. Thou shalt yet plant vineyards in the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, &amp; till the time come they shall not make vintage: because there shall be a day, wherein the watchmen on mount Ephraim shall cry: Arise, and let us go up unto Sion to the Lord our God. Because thus saith our Lord: Rejoice in gladness o Jacob, and neigh against the head of the Gentiles: sound ye, and sing, and say: Save o Lord thy people the remnant of Israel. Behold I will bring them out of the land of the North, and will gather them from the ends of the earth: among whom shall be the blind and the lame, and woman with child, and she that beareth child together, a great company of them that return hither. They shall come in weeping: and in mercy I will reduce them: and I will bring them through the torrents of waters in a right way, and they shall not stumble in it: because I am become a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-begotten. Hear the word of our Lord ye Nations, &amp; shew forth in the islands, that are far off, and say: He that dispersed Israel, will gather him: and he will keep him as the Pastor his flock. For our Lord hath redeemed Jacob, and he will deliver him out of the hand of the mightier. And they shall come, and shall praise in mount Sion: and they shall run together to the good things of our Lord for the corn, and wine, and oil, and the increase of cattle and herds, and their soul shall be as a watered garden, and they shall be hungry no more. Then shall the virgin rejoice in the choir, the young men &amp; old men together: and I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them joyful from their sorrow. And I will replenish the soul of the Priests with fatness: and my people shall be filled with my good things, saith our Lord. Thus saith our Lord: A voice of lamentation is heard on high of the mourning, and weeping of Rachel weeping for her children, and refusing to be comforted for them, because they are not. Thus saith our Lord: Let thy voice cease from weeping, and thine eyes from tears: because there is a reward for thy work, saith our Lord: and they shall return out of the land of the enemy. And there is hope to thy last ends, saith our Lord: &amp; the children shall return to their borders. Hearing I heard Ephraim going into transmigration. Thou hast chastised me, &amp; I am taught, as a young bullock not tamed. Convert me, and I shall be converted: because thou art the Lord my God. For after thou didst convert me I did penance: &amp; after thou didst shew unto me, I struck my thigh: I am confounded, and ashamed, because I have sustained the reproach of my youth. Certes Ephraim is an honourable son to me, certes a delicate child: because since I spake of him, as yet will I remember him. Therefore are my bowels troubled upon him: pitying I will pity him, saith our Lord. Set thee a watch tower, make unto thee bitterness: direct thy heart into the right way wherein thou hast walked: return, o virgin Israel, return to these thy cities. How long wilt thou be dissolute in deliciousness, o wandering daughter? Because our Lord hath created a new thing upon the earth: A WOMAN SHALL COMPASS A MAN. Thus saith the Lord of hosts the God of Israel: As yet shall they say this word in the land of Juda, &amp; in the cities thereof, when I shall convert their captivity: Our Lord bless thee the beauty of justice, the holy mountain. and Judas and all his cities shall dwell in it together: the husbandmen and they that drive the flocks. Because I have inebriated the weary soul: and every hungry soul I have filled. Therefore I was raised up as out of a sleep, and I saw, and my sleep was sweet to me. Behold the days come, saith our Lord: and I will sow the house of Israel &amp; the house of Juda with the seed of men, &amp; with the seed of beasts. And as I have watched upon them, to pluck up, and deface, and dissipate, &amp; destroy, and afflict: so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant them, saith our Lord. In those days they shall say no more: The fathers did eat the bitter grape, and the teeth of the children are set on edge. But every one shall die in his own iniquity: every man that shall eat the sour grape, his teeth shall be on edge. Behold the days shall come, saith our Lord: and I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Juda: not according to the covenant, which I made with their fathers in the day that I took their hand, to bring them out of the Land of Aegypt: the covenant which they made void, and I had the dominion of them, saith our Lord. But this shall be the covenant, that I will make with the house of Israel: after those days saith our Lord: I will give my law in their bowels, and in their heart I will write it: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And a man shall no more teach his neighbour, and a man his brother, saying: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Know our Lord: for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest, saith our Lord: because I will be propitious to their iniquity, and their sin I will remember no more. Thus saith our Lord, that giveth the sun for the light of the day, the order of the moon and of the stars, for the light of the night: that troubleth the sea, and the waves thereof do sound, the Lord of hosts is his name. If these laws shall fail before me, saith our Lord: thee also the seed of Israel shall fail, that it be not a nation before me for ever. Thus saith our Lord: If the heavens above shall be able to be measured, and the foundations of the earth beneath to be searched out: I also will cast away all the seed of Israel, for all things that they have done, saith our Lord. Behold the days come, saith our Lord: and the city shall be built to our Lord from the tower of Hananeel even to the gate of the corner. And the rule of the measure shall go out farther in his sight upon the little hill Gareb: and it shall compass Goatha, and all the valley of carcasses, and of ashes, and all the country of death, even to the torrent of Cedron, and to the corner of the East gate of horses. The Holy of our Lord shall not be plucked up, and it shall no more be destroyed for ever.</div>
