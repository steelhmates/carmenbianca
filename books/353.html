			<div class='roleText'>He made also houses for himself in the city of David: and built a place for the Ark of God, and pitcht a tabernacle for it. Then said David: It is unlawful that the Ark of God be carried of any man, but of the Levites: whom our Lord chose to carry it, and to minister unto himself for ever. And he gathered together all Israel into Jerusalem, that the Ark of God might be brought into his place, which he had prepared for it. Moreover also the sons of Aaron, and the Levites. Of the children of Caath, Uriel was the Prince, and his brethren an hundred twenty. Of the sons of Merari, Asaia the Prince: and his brethren two hundred twenty. Of the sons of Gersom, Joel the Prince: and his brethren an hundred thirty. Of the sons of Elisaphan, Semeias the Prince: and his brethren two hundred. Of the sons of Hebron, Eliel the Prince: and his brethren eighty. Of the sons of Oziel, Aminadab the Prince: and his brethren an hundred twelve. And David called Sadoc and Abiathar the Priests, and the Levites, Uriel, Asaia, Joel, Semeia, Eliel, and Aminadab: and he said to them: You that are the Princes of the Levitical families, be sanctified with your brethren, and fetch the Ark of our Lord the God of Israel to the place, which is prepared for it: lest as from the beginning, because you were not present, our Lord struck us: so now also it come to pass, we doing some unlawful thing. The Priests therefore, and the Levites were sanctified, to carry the Ark of our Lord the God of Israel. And the sons of Levi took the Ark of God, as Moyses had commanded, according to the word of our Lord, upon their shoulders, on bars. And David said to the Princes of the Levites, that they should appoint of their brethren singing men on musical instruments, to wit, on nables, and harps, and cymbals, that the sound of joy might resound on high. And they appointed Levites: Heman the son of Joel, and of his brethren Asaph the son of Barachias: and of the children of Merari, their brethren: Ethan the son of Casaia. And with them their brethren: in the second order, Zacharias, &amp; Ben, &amp; Jaziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel, and Ani, Eliab, and Banaias, and Maasias, and Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias, and Obededom, and Jehiel, porters. Moreover them that sang, Heman, Asaph and Ethan: sounding on brazen cymbals. And Zacharias, and Oziel, and Semiramoth, and Jahiel, and Ani, and Eliab, and Maasias, and Banaias upon nables sang mysteries. Moreover Mathathias, and Eliphalu, and Macenias, and Obededom, and Jehiel, and Ozaziu, upon harps for the octave sang a triumphant song. And Chonenias the Prince of the Levites, was chief over Prophecy, to begin the melody: for he was very cunning. And Barachias, and Elcana: door keepers of the Ark. Moreover Sebenias, and Josaphat, and Nathanael, and Amasai, and Zacharias, and Banaias, and Eliezer Priests, sounded with trumpets, before the Ark of God: and Obededom, and Jehias kept the door of the Ark. Therefore David and all the ancients of Israel, and the tribunes, went to fetch the Ark of the covenant of our Lord, out of the house of Obededom with joy. And when God had holpen the Levites, which carried the Ark of the covenant of our Lord, there were immolated seven oxen, and seven rams. Moreover David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, &amp; all the Levites that carried the Ark, and the singing men, and Chonenias the Prince of prophecy among the singers: and David also was clothed with an Ephod of linen. And all Israel brought the Ark of the covenant of our Lord in jubilee, and sounding with the sound of shalm, and with trumpets, and cymbals, and nables, and harps. And when the Ark of the covenant of our Lord was come unto the city of David, Michol the daughter of Saul looking forth through a window, saw David the king dancing and playing, and she despised him in her heart.</div>
