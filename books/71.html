			<div class='roleText'>These are the judgments which thou shalt propose to them. If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years shall he serve thee: in the seventh he shall go out free gratis. With the raiment he entered in, with the like let him go out: if having a wife, his wife also shall go out with him. But if his Lord give him a wife, and she bear sons &amp; daughters, the woman and her children shall be her Lord's; but himself shall go out with his raiment. And if the servant say: I love my Lord and wife &amp; children, I will not go out free: his lord shall present him to the gods, and he shall be set to the door and the posts, and he shall bore his ear through with an awl: and he shall be his bond man for ever. If any man sell his daughter to be a servant, she shall not go out, as bondwomen are wont to go out. If she mislike the eyes of her master to whom she was delivered, he shall dismiss her: but he shall not have authority to sell her unto a strange people, if he despise her. But if he despouse her to his son, he shall do to her after the manner of daughters. And if he take another wife for him, he shall provide her a marriage, and raiment, and the price of her chastity he shall not deny. If he do not these three things, she shall go out gratis without money. He that striketh a man willfully to kill him, dying let him die. But he that did not lie in wait for him, but God delivered him into his hands, I will appoint thee a place whereunto he ought to fly. If a man of set purpose kill his neighbour, and by lying in wait for him, thou shalt pluck him out from mine Altar, that he may die. He that striketh his father or mother, dying let him die. He that shall steal a man, and sell him, being convicted of the trespass, dying let him die. He that curseth his father, or mother, dying let him die. If men fall at words, and the one strike his neighbour with a stone or with his fist, and he die not, but lie in his bed: if he rise, and walk abroad upon his staff, he that did strike shall be quit, yet so that he make restitution for his work, and for his expenses upon the physicians. He that striketh his man or maid-servant with a rod, and they die in his hands, he shall be guilty of the crime. But if the party remain alive a day or two, he shall not be subject to punishment, because it is his money. If certain fall at words, and one strike a woman with child, and she indeed abort, but herself live; he shall be subject to so much damage as the woman's husband shall require, and as arbiters shall award. But if her death do ensue thereupon, he shall render life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, adustion for adustion, wound for wound, stripe for stripe. If any man strike the eye of his man-servant or maid-servant, and leave them but one eye, he shall make them free for the eye which he put out. Also if he strike out a tooth of his man-servant or maid-servant, he shall in like manner make them free. If an ox with his horn strike a man or a woman, and they die, he shall be stoned: and his flesh shall not be eaten, the owner also of the ox shall be quit. But if the ox were wont to strike from yesterday and the day before, and they warned his master, neither did he shut him up, and he kill a man or a woman; both the ox shall be stoned, &amp; they shall put to death his owner also. And if they set a price upon him, he shall give for his life whatsoever he is asked. Also if with his horn he strike a son, or a daughter, he shall be subject to the like sentence. If he invade a bondman or bondwoman, he shall give thirty sicles of silver to their master, but the ox shall be stoned. If a man open a cistern, &amp; dig one, &amp; do not cover it, and an ox or an ass fall into it, the owner of the cistern shall pay the price of the beasts: and that which died shall be his own. If one man's ox gore another man's ox, &amp; he die, they shall sell the ox that liveth, and shall divide the price, and the carcass of that which died they shall part between them. But if he knew that his ox was wont to strike from yesterday and the day before, and his master did not keep him in, he shall render ox for ox, and shall take the carcass whole.</div>
