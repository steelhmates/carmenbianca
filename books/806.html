			<div class='roleText'>The burden of the desert sea. As whirlwinds come from the South, it cometh from the desert, from an horrible land. A sore vision was told me: he that is incredulous doth unfaithfully: &amp; he that is a spoiler, wasteth. Come up Aelam, besiege o Mede: I have made all the mourning thereof to cease. Therefore are my loins filled with sorrow, anguish hath possessed me, as the anguish of a woman that travaileth: I fell down when I heard it, I was troubled when I saw it. Mine heart failed, darkness made me astonished: Babylon my beloved is made a miracle unto me. Lay the table, look about in the watch tower the eaters and drinkers: arise ye Princes, take shield. For thus hath our Lord said to me: Go, and set a watchman: and what soever he shall see, let him tell. And he saw a chariot of two horsemen, a rider upon an ass, and a rider upon a camel: and he beheld them diligently with much looking.

For they are fled from the face of the swords, from the face of the sword hanging over, from the face of the bow bent, from the face of a grievous battle. Because thus saith our Lord to me: Yet in one year, as in the year of an hired man, and all the glory of Cedar shall be taken away.
