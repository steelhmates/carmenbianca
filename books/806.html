			<div class='roleText'>The burden of the desert sea. As whirlwinds come from the South, it cometh from the desert, from an horrible land. A sore vision was told me: he that is incredulous doth unfaithfully: &amp; he that is a spoiler, wasteth. Come up Aelam, besiege o Mede: I have made all the mourning thereof to cease. Therefore are my loins filled with sorrow, anguish hath possessed me, as the anguish of a woman that travaileth: I fell down when I heard it, I was troubled when I saw it. Mine heart failed, darkness made me astonished: Babylon my beloved is made a miracle unto me. Lay the table, look about in the watch tower the eaters and drinkers: arise ye Princes, take shield. For thus hath our Lord said to me: Go, and set a watchman: and what soever he shall see, let him tell. And he saw a chariot of two horsemen, a rider upon an ass, and a rider upon a camel: and he beheld them diligently with much looking.
