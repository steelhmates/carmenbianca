Be ready in the morning, that thou mayest forthwith go up into the mount Sinai, and thou shalt stand with me upon the top of the mount. Let no man go up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout the whole mount: the oxen also and the sheep let them not feed over-against. </div>

And when our Lord was descended in a cloud, Moyses stood with him, calling upon the name of our Lord. Who passing before him said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>I will make a covenant in the sight of all. I will do signs that were never seen upon the earth, nor in any nations: that this people may see, in the midst of whom thou art, the terrible work of the Lord, which I will do. Observe all things which this day I command thee: I myself will cast out before thy face the Amorrheite, &amp; Chananeite, &amp; Hetheite, the Pherezeite also, and Heveite, and Jebuseite. Beware thou never join amity with the inhabitants of that land, which may be thy ruin: but destroy their altars, break their statues, and cut down their groves: adore not a strange God. The Lord his name is Jealous, God is an emulator. Enter no traffic with the men of those regions: lest when they have fornicated with their gods, &amp; have adored their idols, some man call thee to eat of the things immolated. Neither shalt thou take a wife for thy sons of their daughters: lest after themselves have fornicated they make thy sons also to fornicate with their gods. Molten gods thou shalt not make to thee. Thou shalt keep the solemnity of the azymes. Seven days shalt thou eat azymes, as I have commanded thee, in the time of the month of new corn: for in the month of spring time thou didst go out of Aegypt. All of the male kind, that openeth the matrice, shall be mine. Of all beasts, as well oxen as of sheep, it shall be mine. The first-born of an ass thou shalt redeem with a sheep: but if thou wilt not give a price for it, it shall be slain. The first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem: neither shalt thou appear empty in my sight. Six days shalt thou work, the seventh day thou shalt cease to ear &amp; reap. The solemnity of weeks thou shalt make to thee, in the first fruits of corn of thy wheat harvest, and the solemnity, when the time of the year returneth that all things are laid up. Three times of the year all thy male shall appear in the sight of the omnipotent Lord God of Israel. For when I shall have taken away the nations from thy face, and shall have dilated thy borders, no man shall lie in wait against thy land, when thou doest go up, and appear in the sight of the Lord thy God thrice in a year. Thou shalt not immolate the blood of my host upon leaven: neither shall there remain in the morning of the victim of the solemnity of the Phase. The first of the fruits of thy ground thou shalt offer in the house of the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a kid in the milk of his dam. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Therefore he was there with our Lord forty days &amp; forty nights: he did not eat bread, and he drunk no water, &amp; he wrote in the tables the words of the covenant, ten. And when Moyses came down from the mount Sinai, he held the two tables of testimony, and he knew not that his face was horned by the conversation of the talk of our Lord. And Aaron &amp; the children of Israel seeing the face of Moyses horned, they were afraid to come near. And being called of him, they returned as well Aaron as the Princes of the Synagogue. And after that he spake to them, all the children of Israel also came to him: whom he commanded all things that he had heard of our Lord in mount Sinai. And having ended his talk, he put a veil upon his face. Which going in to our Lord, and speaking with him, he took away until he went forth, and then he spake to the children of Israel all things that had been commanded him, who saw that the face of Moyses coming forth was horned, but he covered his face again, if at any time he spake to them.</div>
