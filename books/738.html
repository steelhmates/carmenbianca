			<div class='roleText'>Son defraud not the alms of the poor, and turn not away thine eyes from the poor. Despise not the hungry soul: and exasperate not the poor in his poverty. Afflict not the heart of the needy, &amp; defer not the gift to him that is in distress. Reject not the petition of him that is afflicted: and turn not away thy face from the needy. From the poor turn not away thine eyes for anger: and leave not to them that ask of thee, to curse thee behind thy back. For the prayer of him that curseth thee in the bitterness of his soul shall be heard: and he that made him, will hear him. Make thyself affable to the congregation of the poor, and to the ancient humble thy soul, and to a great man bow thy head. Bow down thine ear to the poor without sadness, and render thy debt, and answer him peaceable words in mildness. Deliver him that suffereth injury out of the hand of the proud: and be not faint-hearted in thy soul. In judging be merciful to pupils as a father, &amp; as an husband to their mother: and thou shalt be as the obedient son of the Highest, and he will have mercy on thee more than a mother. Wisdom inspireth life to her children, and receiveth them that seek after her, and will go before them in the way of justice. And he that loveth her, loveth life: and they that shall watch to her, shall embrace her sweetness. They that shall hold her, shall inherit life: and whither-soever he shall enter, God will bless him. They that serve her, shall be servants to the holy: and them that love her God loveth. He that heareth her, shall judge nations: and he that beholdeth her, shall remain confident. If he believe her, he shall inherit her, and her creatures shall be in confirmation: because in tentation she walketh with him, and first of all she chooseth him. Fear, and dread, and probation she will bring upon him: and she will torment him in the tribulation of her doctrine, till she try him in her cogitations and credit his soul. And she will establish him, and make a direct way unto him, and rejoice him, and will disclose her secrets to him, and will heap upon him as treasures knowledge &amp; understanding of justice. But if he go amiss, she will forsake him, and deliver him into the hands of his enemy. Son observe time, and avoid from evil. For thy soul be not ashamed to say the truth. For there is shame that bringeth sin, &amp; there is shame that bringeth glory and grace. Accept no face against thine own face, nor against thy soul a lie. Reverence not thy neighbour in his offence: nor keep in a word in time of salvation. Hide not thy wisdom in the beauty thereof. For by the tongue wisdom is discerned: and understanding, and knowledge, and doctrine by the word of the wise, and steadfastness in the works of justice. Do not gainsay the word of truth by any means: and be ashamed of the lie of thine unskillfulness. Be not ashamed to confess thy sins, and submit not thyself to every man for sin. Resist not against the face of the mighty, neither labour against the stream of the river. For justice contend for thy soul, and unto death strive for justice, and God will overthrow thine enemies for thee. Be not hasty in thy tongue: and unprofitable and remiss in thy works. Be not as a lion in thy house, overthrowing them of thy household, and oppressing them that are subject to thee. Let not thine hand be stretched out to receive, and closed to give.</div>
