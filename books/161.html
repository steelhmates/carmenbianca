			<div class='roleText'>Every commandment, that I command thee this day, take diligent heed that thou do it: that you may live, and be multiplied, and entering in may possess the Land, for the which our Lord sware to your fathers. And thou shalt remember all the journey, through the which the Lord thy God hath brought thee forty years by the desert, that he might afflict &amp; prove thee, &amp; that the things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or not. He afflicted thee with penury, and gave thee for meat Manna, which thou knewest not nor thy fathers: for to shew unto thee that not in bread only a man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God. Thy raiment, wherewith thou wast covered hath not decayed for age, and thy foot is not worn, lo this is the fortieth year. That thou mayest recount in thy heart, that as a man disciplineth his son, so the Lord thy God hath disciplined thee, that thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and fear him. For the Lord thy God will bring thee in unto a good land, a land of rivers and waters and of fountains: in the plains whereof and mountains deep floods gush out: a land of wheat, of barley, and vineyards, wherein fig trees and pomegranates, and oliveyards do grow: a land of oil and honey. Where without any penury thou shalt eat thy bread, and enjoy abundance of all things: whose stones are iron, and out of the mountains thereof are digged metals of brass: that when thou hast eaten, and art full, thou mayest bless the Lord thy God for the excellent land, which he hath given thee. Observe, and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy God, and neglect his commandments and judgments and ceremonies, which I command thee this day: lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly houses, and dwelled in them, and shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, of gold and silver, and of all things plenty, thy heart be lifted up, and thou remember not the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of Aegypt, out of the house of servitude: and was thy conductor in the huge and terrible wilderness, wherein was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and the dipsas, and no waters at all: who brought forth rivers out of the hardest rock, and fed thee with Manna in the wilderness, which thy fathers knew not. And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at the last he had mercy upon thee, lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: Mine own force, &amp; the strength of mine own hand, have achieved all these things for me. But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee strength, that he might fulfill his covenant, concerning which he sware to thy fathers, as this present day sheweth. But if forgetting the Lord thy God, thou shalt follow strange gods, and shalt serve and adore them: behold now I foretell thee that thou shalt perish utterly. As the Nations, which our Lord destroyed at thine entry, so shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord your God.</div>
