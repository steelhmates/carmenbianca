			<div class='roleText'>Speak to the children of Israel, and thou shalt say to them: When you shall be entered into the Land of your habitation, which I will give you, and shall make oblation to the Lord for an holocaust, or victim, paying vows, or voluntarily offering gifts, or in your solemnities burning a sweet savour unto the Lord, of oxen or of sheep: whosoever immolateth the victim, shall offer a sacrifice of flour, the tenth part of an ephi tempered with oil, which shall have in measure the fourth part of an hin: and wine of the same measure to pour the libaments shall he give for the holocaust or for the victim. For every lamb and ram there shall be a sacrifice of flour of two tenths, which shall be tempered with oil the third part of an hin: and wine for the libament, the third part of the same measure, shall he offer for a sweet savour to the Lord. But when thou makest an holocaust or host of oxen, to fulfill thy vow, or for pacific victims, thou shalt give for every oxe three tenths of flour tempered with oil, which shall have half the measure of a hin: and wine to pour libaments of the same measure for an oblation of most sweet savour to the Lord. So shalt thou do for every oxe and ram and lamb &amp; buck goat. As well they that are born in the country as the strangers after one rite shall offer sacrifices. There shall be all one precept &amp; judgment as well to yourselves as to the strangers of the land. </div>

			<div class='roleText'>Speak to the children of Israel, &amp; thou shalt say to them: When you are come into the land, which I will give you, and shall eat of the breads of that country, you shall separate first fruits to the Lord of your meats. As of your barn floors you separate first fruits, so of your pasts shall you give first fruits to the Lord. And if through ignorance you omit any of these things, which the Lord hath spoken to Moyses, and by him hath commanded you, from the day that he began to command and so forward, and the multitude have forgotten to do it: they shall offer a calf out of the herd, an holocaust for a most sweet savour to the Lord, and the sacrifice and libaments thereof, as the ceremonies require, and a buck goat for sin: and the Priest shall pray for all the multitude of the children of Israel: and it shall be forgiven them, because they sinned not wittingly, offering notwithstanding burnt sacrifice to the Lord for themselves and for their sin and error: and it shall be forgiven all the people of the children of Israel, and the strangers, that sojourn among them: because it is the fault of all the people through ignorance. But if one soul shall sin unwitting, he shall offer a she goat of a year old for his sin: and the Priest shall pray for him, because he sinned unwitting before the Lord: and he shall obtain him pardon, and it shall be forgiven him. As well to them that are born in the country as to the strangers one law shall be for all, that sin by ignorance. But the soul, that through pride committeth any thing, whether he be born in the country, or a stranger, (because he hath been rebellious against the Lord) shall perish out of his people: for he hath contemned the word of the Lord, and made his precept of no effect: therefore shall he be destroyed, and shall bear his iniquity. </div>
