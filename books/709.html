			<div class='roleText'>I am the flower of the field, and the lily of the valleys. As the lily among the thorns, so is my love among the daughters. As the apple-tree among trees of the woods, so is my beloved among the sons. Under his shadow, whom I desired, I sat: and his fruit was sweet unto my throat. He brought me into the wine cellar, he hath ordered in me charity. Stay me up with flowers, compass me about with apples: because I languish with love. His left hand under my head, and his right hand shall embrace me. I adjure you o daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and the harts of the fields that you raise not, nor make the beloved to awake, until herself will. The voice of my beloved, behold he cometh leaping in the mountains, leaping over the little hills: my beloved is like unto a roe, and to a fawn of harts. Behold he standeth behind our wall, looking through the window, looking forth by the grates. Behold my beloved speaketh to me: Arise, make haste my love, my dove, my beautiful one, and come. For winter is now past, the rain is gone, and departed. The flowers have appeared in our land, the time of pruning is come: the voice of the turtle-dove is heard in our land: the fig-tree hath brought forth her green figs: the flourishing vineyards have given their savour. Arise my love, my beautiful one, &amp; come. My dove in the holes of the rock, in the hollow places of the wall, shew me thy face, let thy voice sound in mine ears: for thy voice is sweet, and thy face comely. Catch us the little foxes, that destroy the vineyards: for our vineyard hath flourished. My beloved to me, and I to him, who feedeth among the lilies, till the day break, and the shadows decline. Return: be like, my beloved, to a roe, and to the fawn of harts upon the mountains of Bether.</div>
