			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end, to the servant of our Lord David himself. The unjust hath said within himself, that he would sin: there is no fear of God before his eyes. Because he hath done deceitfully in his sight: that his iniquity may be found unto hatred. The words of his mouth are iniquity, and guile: he would not understand that he might do well. He hath meditated iniquity in his bed: he hath set himself on every way not good, and malice he hath not hated. Lord thy mercy is in heaven: and thy truth even to the clouds. Thy justice as the hills of God: thy judgments are great depth. Men &amp; beasts thou wilt save, o Lord, as thou hast multiplied thy mercy, o God. But the children of men shall hope in the covert of thy wings. They shall be inebriated with the plenty of thy house: and with the torrent of thy pleasure thou shalt make them drink. Because with thee is the fountain of life: and in thy light we shall see light. Extend thy mercy to them that know thee, and thy justice to them, that are of a right heart. Let not the foot of pride come to me: and let not the hand of a sinner move me. There have they fallen that work iniquity: they were expelled, neither could they stand.</div>
