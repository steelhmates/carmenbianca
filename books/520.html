			<div class='roleText'>Unto the end in songs, the Psalm of David for the octave. Lord, rebuke me not in thy fury; nor chastise me in thy wrath. Have mercy on me Lord, because I am weak: heal me Lord, because all my bones be troubled. And my soul is troubled exceedingly: but thou Lord how long? Turn thee, o Lord, and deliver my soul: save me for thy mercy. Because there is not in death that is mindful of thee: and in hell who shall confess to thee? I have laboured in my sighing, I will every night wash my bed; I will water my couch with my tears. My eye is troubled for fury: I have waxen old among all mine enemies. Depart from me all ye that work iniquity: because our Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. Our Lord hath heard my petition, our Lord hath received my prayer. Let all mine enemies be ashamed, &amp; very sore troubled: let them be converted and ashamed very quickly.</div>
