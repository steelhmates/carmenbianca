			<div class='roleText'>Alleluia. I will confess to thee, o Lord, with all my heart: in the counsel of the just, and the congregation. The works of our Lord are great: exquisite according to all his wills. Confession and magnificence his work: and his justice continueth for ever and ever. He hath made a memory of his marvelous works; a merciful &amp; pitiful Lord: he hath given meat to them that fear him. He will be mindful for ever of his testament: the force of his works he will shew forth to his people: To give them the inheritance of the gentiles: the works of his hands truth and judgment. All his commandments are faithful: confirmed for ever and ever, made in truth and equity. He sent redemption to his people: he commanded his testament for ever. Holy and terrible is his name: the fear of our Lord is the beginning of wisdom. Understanding is good to all that do it: his praise remaineth for ever and ever.</div>
