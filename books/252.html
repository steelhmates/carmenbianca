			<div class='roleText'>And our Lord said to Samuel: How long dost thou mourn Saul, whom I have rejected that he rule not over Israel? Fill thy horn with oil, and come, that I may send thee to Isai the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his sons. And Samuel said: </div>

And thou shalt call Isai to the victim, and I will shew thee what thou must do, and thou shalt anoint whomsoever I shall shew to thee. Samuel therefore did as our Lord spake to him. And he came into Bethlehem, and the ancients of the city marveled meeting him, and they said: </div>

And our Lord said to Samuel: Respect not his countenance, nor the tallness of his stature: because I have rejected him, neither do I judge according to the look of man: for man seeth those things which appear, but our Lord beholdeth the heart. And Isai called Aminadab, and brought him before Samuel. Who said: </div>

Samuel therefore took the horn of oil, &amp; anointed him in the midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of our Lord from that day &amp; so forward was directed upon David: &amp; Samuel rising went into Ramatha. And the Spirit of our Lord departed from Saul, and a wicked spirit vexed him, from our Lord. And the servants of Saul said to him: Behold an evil spirit of God vexeth thee. Let our Lord command, and thy servants which are before thee will seek a man skillful to play on the harp, that when the evil spirit of our Lord shall take thee, he may play with his hand, and thou bear it more easily. And Saul said to his servants: Provide me therefore some man that playeth well, and bring him to me. And one of the servants answering, said: </div>
