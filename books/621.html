			<div class='roleText'>A canticle of Psalm, to David himself. My heart is ready, o God, my heart is ready: I will chant and will sing in my glory. Arise my glory, arise psalter and harp: I will arise early. I will confess to thee in peoples, o Lord: and I will sing to thee in the Nations. Because thy mercy is great above the heavens: &amp; thy truth even to the clouds. Be exalted above the heavens o God, and thy glory over all the earth: that thy beloved may be delivered. Save with thy right hand, and hear me: God spake in his holy: I will rejoice, and will divide Sichem, and I will measure the vale of tabernacles. Galaad is mine, and Manasses is mine: and Ephraim the protection of my head. Juda is my king: Moab the pot of my hope. Upon Idumea I will extend my shoe: the strangers are made my friends. Who will conduct me into a fenced city? Who will conduct me into Idumea? Wilt not thou, o God, which hast repelled us, and wilt not thou go forth, o God, in our hosts? Give us help out of tribulation: because man's salvation is vain. In God we shall do strength: and he will bring our enemies to nothing.</div>
