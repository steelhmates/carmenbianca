			<div class='roleText'>Be not for a friend made an enemy to thy neighbour: for the evil man shall inherit reproach and contumely, and every sinner envious and double tongued. Extol not thyself in the cogitation of thy soul as it were a bull: lest perhaps thy strength be quashed, and it eat thy leaves, and destroy thy fruits, and thou be left as a dry tree in the wilderness. For a wicked soul shall destroy him that hath it, and it giveth him to be a joy to his enemies, and shall lead him into the lot of the impious. A sweet word multiplieth friends, &amp; appeaseth enemies, and a gracious tongue in a good man aboundeth. Let there be many at peace with thee, and let one of a thousand be thy counseller. If thou possess a friend, in tentation possess him, and not easily credit him. For he is a friend according to his own time, and will not abide in the day of tribulation And there is a friend that is turned to enmity: and there is a friend that will disclose hatred, and reproaches. And there is a friend companion at the table, and he will not abide in the day of necessity. A friend if he continue steadfast, shall be to thee as an equal, and in them of thy household shall deal confidently: if he humble himself against thee, and hide himself from thy face, thou shalt have friendship of one accord for good. Be separated from thine enemies, &amp; take heed of thy friends. A faithful friend, is a strong protection: and he that hath found him, hath found a treasure. To a faithful friend there is no comparison, and there is no poise of gold and silver able to countervail the goodness of his fidelity. A faithful friend, is the medicine of life &amp; immortality: &amp; they that fear our Lord, shall find him. He that feareth God, shall likewise have good friendship: because according to him shall his friend be. Son, from thy youth receive doctrine, and even to thy hoar hairs thou shalt find wisdom. As he that ploweth, and that soweth, go to her, and expect her good fruits. For in her work thou shalt labour a little, and shalt quickly eat of her generation. How exceeding sharp is wisdom to the unlearned men, and the unwise will not continue in her. As the virtue of a stone she shall be a probation in them, and they will not stay to cast her forth. For the wisdom of doctrine is according to her name, and she is not manifest to many, but to whom she is known, she continueth even to the sight of God. Hear my son, and take counsel of understanding, and cast not away my counsel. Thrust thy foot into her fetters, and thy neck into her chains. Put under thy shoulder, and carry her, and be not weary of her bands. With all thy mind go to her, and with all thy strength keep her ways. Search her out, and she shall be made manifest to thee, and having obtained her, forsake her not: For in the later end, thou shalt find rest in her, and she shall be turned unto delectation. And her fetters shall be to thee for a protection of strength, and foundation of power, &amp; her chains for a stole of glory: For the beauty of life is in her, and her bands are a healthful binding. Thou shalt put on her a stole of glory, and as a crown of gratulation thou shalt set her upon thee. Son, if thou attend to me, thou shalt learn: and if thou wilt apply thy mind, thou shalt be wise. If thou wilt incline thine ear, thou shalt receive doctrine: and if thou love to hear, thou shalt be wise. Stand in the multitude of wise ancients, and be joined to their wisdom from thy heart, that thou mayst hear all the narration of God, and the praise may not escape thee. And if thou see a wise man, watch after him, and let thy foot wear the steps of his doors. Have thy cogitation in the precepts of God, and in his commandments most of all be daily conversant: and he will give thee heart, and the desire of wisdom shall be given thee.</div>
