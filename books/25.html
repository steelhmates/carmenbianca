			<div class='roleText'>And Abraham married another wife named Cetura: Which bare him Zamran, and Jecsan, and Madan, and Madian, and Jesboc, and Sue. Jecsan also begat Saba &amp; Dadan. The Children of Dadan were Assurim, and Latusim, and Loomim. But also of Madian was born Epha, and Opher, and Henoch, and Abida, and Eldaa: all these were the children of Cetura. And Abraham gave all his possessions to Isaac: and to the children of his concubines he gave gifts, and separated them from Isaac his son, whilst himself yet lived, to the east country.
