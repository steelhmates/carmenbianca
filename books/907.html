			<div class='roleText'>How is the gold darkened, the best colour changed, the stones of the sanctuary dispersed in the head of all streets? The noble children of Sion, &amp; they that were clothed with the principal gold: how are they reputed as earthen vessels, the work of the potter's hands? Yea even the lamiaes have opened their breast, they have given suck to their young, the daughter of my people is cruel, as the ostrich in the desert. The tongue of the suckling hath cloven to the roof of his mouth for thirst: the little ones have asked bread, and there was none that brake it unto them. They that fed voluptuously, have died in the ways: they that were brought up in scarlet, have embraced the dung. And the iniquity of the daughter of my people is become greater than the sin of Sodom: which was overthrown in a moment, and hands took nothing in her. Her Nazareites whiter than snow, purer than milk, ruddier than the old ivory, fairer than the sapphire. Their face is made blacker than coals, and they are not known in the streets: their skin hath cloven to their bones, it is withered, and is made as wood. It was better with them that were slain with the sword, than with them that were killed by famine: because these pined away consumed by the barrenness of the country. The hands of pitiful women have sodden their own children: they were made their meat in the destruction of the daughter of my people. Our Lord hath accomplished his fury, he hath poured out the wrath of his indignation: and he hath kindled a fire in Sion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof. The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world did not believe, that the adversary and the enemy should enter in by the gates of Jerusalem. For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, which have shed the blood of just men in the midst of her. The blind wandered in the streets, they were polluted with blood: and when they could not, they held their skirts. Depart ye polluted, they cried to them: depart, get ye hence, touch not: for they brawled, &amp; were moved: they said among the Gentiles: He will add no more to dwell among them. The face of our Lord hath divided them, he will not add to respect them: they have not reverenced the faces of the priests, neither had they pity on the ancients. Whilst we yet stood, our eyes failed towards our vain help, when we looked attentive to a nation, that was not able to save. Our steps slipped in the way of our streets, our end draweth near: our days are accomplished, because our end is come. Our persecuters were swifter than the eagles of the heaven: upon the mountains they pursued us, in the desert they lay in wait against us. The spirit of our mouth Christ our Lord is taken in our sins: to whom we have said: </div>

			<div class='roleText'>In thy shadow shall we live among the Gentiles. Rejoice, and be glad o daughter of Edom, which dwellest in the Land of Hus: to thee also shall the cup come, thou shalt be made drunken, and naked. Thine iniquity is accomplished o daughter of Sion, he will add no more to transport thee: he hath visited thine iniquity o daughter of Edom, he hath discovered thy sins.</div>
